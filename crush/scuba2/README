1. License Agreement
#####################################################################

The SCUBA-2 plugin of CRUSH are proprietary and strictly private. You should
use only the modules prepared specifically for you. You can obtain your
personalized plugin from Attila Kovacs <attila[AT]submm.caltech.edu>. By using
the software, you agree to

  * not share your copy of the plugin with anyone, even accidentally (e.g. by
    leaving its files accessible to others), and

  * extend authorship to Attila Kovacs on any publication(s) that result from
    your use of CRUSH.

After installation, you should read the full license agreement ('license.txt' 
in the 'scuba2' sub-directory of crush) to familiarize yourself with the 
restritions imposed by the proprietary license.




#####################################################################
2. Introduction
#####################################################################

This document contains information specific to using CRUSH-2 to reduce SCUBA-2
data. It is assumed that you are already familiar with the contents of the main
CRUSH-2 README (inside the distribution directory), especially its Section 1
(Getting Started).

If you run into difficulty understanding the concepts in this document, you
will probably find it useful to study the main README document a little longer.




#####################################################################
3. Installation
#####################################################################

The SCUBA-2 plugin modules are distributed as a gzipped tarball (or zip file).
Simply uncompress it inside the crush distribution directory. E.g.:

   > cd <crush-distro>
   > tar xzf crush-2.xx-scuba2-x-<username>.tar.gz

The archive file name contains both the crush version number (e.g. 2.01), for
which the plugin is prepared, and the serial version of the SCUBA-2 modules 
(e.g. 1), as well as the username, to which the plugin is locked.

The plugins are intended for use with the designated version of crush (and its
updates). While it is possible that the same plugin may work with other CRUSH 
versions also, there is no guarantee to it. If you want to upgrade CRUSH to the 
latest release, you can request a corresponding update of the plugin from 
<attila[AT]submm.caltech.edu>.

To protect the privacy of the plugin, you should install crush only on your
own machine, or on a personal computer account.

If you install the plugin on a shared computer, you should delete the original 
archive after installation, or else make it unreadable to other users, to 
protect its privacy as agreed by the licensing terms. On UNIX systems, you can 
limit access to the plugin archive by:

   > chmod go-rw crush-2.xx-scuba2-x-<username>.tar.gz



3.1 Updates
===========

   The SCUBA-2 modules of CRUSH are very new, and are subject to active
   development. To make sure, that you have the latest-greatest version, 
   please check the SCUBA-2 pages of the crush web-page regularly 
   (under "Instruments"):

      www.submm.caltech.edu/~sharc/crush

   To check what version of the modules you are using, either run:
  
      > crush scuba2

   (the plugin version is reported immediately under the CRUSH banner), or
   refer to the version number in your personal archive (if you still have it).
   To update to the current version, request new modules from 
   <attila[AT]submm.caltech.edu>.

4. Reading Scans
#####################################################################


4.1 FITS vs. SDF
================

   The SCUBA-2 data are recorded in the proprietary SDF format of the JCMT.
   While the SDF files can be accessed with the Starlink software suite, the 
   format itself is not documented in a way that would allow the creation of an
   independent tool for them. Therefore, CRUSH can access these data only via
   the Starlink suite.

   The Starlink suite provides a utility for converting SDF files to FITS,
   which is the format expected by CRUSH. The 'ndf2fits' tool usually resides 
   in the 'bin/convert' subdirectory of the Starlink installation directory. 

   You have two choices for handling the conversion. You can either do this
   manually, or let CRUSH convert the files on-the-fly, as needed. In either
   case, you will need access to the Starlink software suite. 

   Manual Conversion
   -----------------
   If you opt for manual conversion, make sure to use the 'proexts' option
   of 'ndf2fits'. E.g.:

	> ndf2fits <scan-name>.sdf <scan-name>.fits proexts

   You should name the FITS files exactly like the originals SDF ones, changing
   only the extension from '.sdf' to '.fits'.

  
   On-the-Fly Conversion
   ---------------------
   The alternative is to let CRUSH handle the conversion automatically, by 
   calling on 'ndf2fits' internally. If 'ndf2fits' is in your path, you should
   be set to go. Otherwise, you will have to instruct crush where to find the 
   'ndf2fits' executable. You can do this by editing 'default.cfg' in the 
   'scuba2' subdirectory of crush. Change the value of the 'ndf2fits' keyword 
   to indicate the location of the executable. E.g.:

        ndf2fits /usr/local/starlink/bin/convert/ndf2fits

   If you set this up correctly, CRUSH will manage the conversion of SDF files 
   automatically.

   
   Batch Conversion
   ----------------
   If you are going to reduce your data set over and over (e.g. to optimize 
   reduction settings), it makes sense to convert all your files to FITS once,
   rather than every time you run CRUSH. Thus, CRUSH provides the 'convert'
   option for batch conversions (assuming that the 'ndf2fits' option is set up
   correctly -- see above). Scans are listed the usual way, but instead of 
   reducing them, they are only converted to FITS. You can also specify the
   path, where you want the converted files to be written using 'outpath'.
   (Otherwise, 'datapath' will be used if defined). E.g.

	> crush scuba2 -convert -outpath=/data/fits <scans>

   After the conversion, make sure that your reduction scripts have 'datapath' 
   set to the location of the FITS files. E.g., using the above example:

	> crush scuba2 [...] -datapath=/data/fits [...] <scans>


4.2 '450um' vs '850um' reduction mode
=====================================

   When reducing SCUBA-2 data with CRUSH, you should specify the wavelength, in
   which you are interested. This way CRUSH will load settings that are
   appropriate for mapping in that band. You can choose between '450um' or 
   '850um' reduction modes. E.g., on the command-line:

      > crush scuba2 -450um [...]
   
   If you do not define the wavelength, then '850um' reduction will be assumed.
   (The wavelength does not have to be the first argument, but should precede
   the first scan number or name in the argument list).


4.3 By date and scan number
===========================

   The preferred way of reading SCUBA-2 data is by 'date' and scan number.
   The convention of SCUBA-2 is to spread the scan data over several files.
   Data from each subarray is dumped at some intervals (typically 30s), which 
   are referred to as subscans. Thus, with two subarrays, the data for a 10 
   minute scan are typically spread over 40 files.

   (The file names begin with the subarray id, 's4a' for the current single 
   450um subarray, and 's8d' for the single 850um subarray, then continue with
   the date ('YYYYMMDD' format), scan number, and finally the subscan number.)
   
   Thus, given the location of the data ('datapath' option), the reduction 
   wavelength ('450um' or '850um'), the date (in 'YYYYMMDD' format) and the 
   scan number, CRUSH can easily find all files necessary. E.g.:

      > crush scuba2 -450um -datapath=/home/data/scuba2 -date=20100301 36

   The above line will load all usable subscans of scan #36. Some subscans
   may be designated unusable by CRUSH, either because the subscan contains
   no coordinate data from the telescope (which often happens to the first and
   last subscans in a scan), or because the subscan is too short (<5s) for
   proper processing. These will be dropped from the reduction queue. You can 
   override the minimum length requirement by changing or commenting the 
   'subscans.minlength' option in 'scuba2/default.cfg'

   Scan ranges can be specified as usual, e.g.:

      > crush scuba2 -date=20100301 39-42 45-48 -date=20100302 12-15 17
   
   
4.4 By file names
=================

   The alternative is to specify file names directly. You can use both full
   pathnames (which can contain wildcards and other shell-expansions) or
   give exact file names (without wildcards, etc.) relative to 'datapath'. 
   Locating scans by file names is not recommended in general, since it allows
   for processing 450um scans in '850um' mode (and vice versa) or even mixing
   the data from the different wavelengths. On the other hand, you may want
   to use file-names for locating scans, if:
	
	* your scans are named differently from the standard convention, or

	* you want to control which subscans are processed.

   For example:
	
      > crush scuba2 -450um /data/scuba2/s4a20100301_00036_0002.sdf

   or, equivalently

      > crush scuba2 -450um -datapath=/data/scuba2 s4a20100301_00036_0002.sdf

   will both process only the 2nd subscan of scan 36 (taken on 2010-03-01) in 
   '450um' mode.



#####################################################################
5. Calibration and Pointing
#####################################################################	

The default configuration of CRUSH provides approximate blind calibration, 
expected to be good to 7% rms at 850um, and approximately 23% rms at 450um,
when using aperture fluxes in apertures large enough to contain the SCUBA-2
error beams of the emission.

When using peak fluxes, the blind calibration accuracy is expected to be worse
due to the variations in main-beam efficiency with focus, elevation and
the surface quality of the JCMT.

To improve on the calibration accuracy, you can set the atmospheric extinction
(tau) manually, and provide order-of-unity corrections based on observations
of nearby calibrator sources. 


5.1 Extinction Correction
=========================

   The JCMT records both 225GHz and 186GHz opacities from radiometer 
   measurements. These are stored in the data files. CRUSH uses the 186GHz 
   value with an appropriate scaling relation to the SCUBA-2 bands, to obtain a
   guesstimate of the in-band opacities for the atmospheric extinction 
   correction. 

   You can also specify your preferred tau value, for every group of scans 
   (see the main CRUSH README). You can set an in-band zenith opacity the 
   usual way, for successive scans. E.g.:

      > crush scuba2 [...] -tau=1.21 <scans> [...]

   You can also set your preferred 186GHz or 225GHz tau values (e.g. from daily
   polynomial fits), e.g.:

      > crush scuba2 [...] -tau.225GHz=0.064 <scans> [...]

   or,

      > crush scuba2 [...] -tau.186GHz=0.058 <scans> [...]

   CRUSH will then use the specified value to calculate an equivalent in-band
   opacity for the given '450um' or '850um' band.



5.2 Calibration Correction
==========================

   Even if the opacity is perfectly determined, there are remaining 
   uncertainties in the calibration. These are mainly due to the beam-quality 
   and variations thereof, due to imperfect focusing, gravitational flexing of 
   the JCMT primary with elevation, or changes in surface quality (e.g. before 
   and after a holography run). 

   Because the JCMT beams are not perfectly Gaussian (esp. at 450um), the 
   calibration scaling is also dependent on the type of flux measure used. You
   will need a different flux scaling when using apertures (of different sizes)
   or peak fluxes (for point sources). To calibrate your science target 
   properly you should first determine an order-of-unity calibration correction
   using the same flux measure (peak flux or integrated flux in the *same* 
   aperture) on a known calibrator source. You can use 

      > crush scuba2 -point [...]

   to measure both peak fluxes and fluxes in 98% inclusive apertures on compact
   calibrator sources. You can then determine a appropriate calibration scaling
   as the ratio of expected flux to observed flux. To multiply your science
   data with this scaling, use the 'scale' option of crush. E.g.:

      > crush scuba2 [...] -scale=1.23 <scans> [...]

   The blind calibration of CRUSH is based on apertures large enough to capture
   98% of the integrated source flux of point sources (including the first 
   error beam), because this measure is much less dependent on beam quality. 
   Therefore, if you are to use peak fluxes (e.g. for deep field source 
   extraction) you should pay special attention to derive appropriate 
   calibration scalings using the same method.



5.3 Pointing Corrections
========================

   You can specify incremental pointing corrections as AZ,EL offsets for every
   group of scans, the usual way using the 'pointing' option. E.g.:

      > crush scuba2 [...] -pointing=-2.3,1.6 <scans> [...]
