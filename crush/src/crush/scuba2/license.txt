      *** Proprietary License for the SCUBA-2 modules of CRUSH-2 ***
		      Version 1, 9 September 2010



1. The SCUBA-2 plugin modules of CRUSH-2
========================================

The SCUBA-2 modules of CRUSH-2 are distributed as a plugin separate from the
CRUSH-2 software itself. While the CRUSH-2 software package is covered by an
open source license (GPLv3), the SCUBA-2 modules are strictly proprietary, with
restrictions on its distribution, use, modification and other aspects. These
restrictions are outlined in Section 2 of this document.

This proprietary license covers all files of the SCUBA-2 plugin of CRUSH, all 
files in the directory, in which this license resides, and all files in all 
sub-directories within it. 


2. Licensing Terms
==================

The SCUBA-2 modules of CRUSH-2 are proprietary software. By using it, you
agree to the terms laid out below. The main restrictions for using the
SCUBA-2 plugin of CRUSH are as follows:

	1. You may use only the software prepared specifically for you.
	   If you do not have your personalized copy, you may request one
	   from Attila Kovacs <kovacs[AT]astro.umn.edu> directly.

	2. You may not share or redistribute the software to other persons.
	   If you wish to collaborate on the SCUBA-2 reduction with others,
	   make them obtain their own personalized copies of the required 
	   SCUBA-2 modules. You are also responsible for making sure that your
	   personalized software modules are not accessible to anyone other
	   than you. Thus, you should avoid installing it on shared
	   computers, or accounts that are visible to others, unless you
	   know how to restrict read permissions appropriately.

	3. You may not change or modify the source code or binaries (i.e. 
	   class files). You are also forbidden to reverse engineer the
	   binaries included in your software modules.

	4. By using the SCUBA-2 plugin modules of CRUSH, you agree to offer
	   authorship to Attila Kovacs <attila[AT]submm.caltech.edu> on all 
	   publications (including posters and presentations) that result from 
	   using the SCUBA-2 plugin modules of CRUSH.

	5. By using the SCUBA-2 plugin modules of CRUSH, you also agree to
	   give credit to the CRUSH software, where appropriate. Publications
	   (papers, letters, posters) should reference the CRUSH paper
	   (Kovacs, A., 2006, Proc. SPIE 7020, 45) and/or the PhD thesis
	   of Attila Kovacs (Caltech, 2006). In presentations, memos and
	   other documents relating to your use of the SCUBA-2 modules, it
	   is sufficient to reference CRUSH by its web page:

	     www.submm.caltech.edu/~sharc/crush
	
	6. There is absolutely no warranty relating to the use of these
	   modules.	

This is an open-ended license agreement, with no termination date to its terms.
However, future releases of the same modules (by Attila Kovacs), may contain 
less restrictive licenses. Any potential easing of the terms in future releases
retrospetively applies to the files covered by this license also. Thus, if 
future releases of the SCUBA-2 modules covered by this license, are made public
under a GPL license, then all files covered by this license will also 
automatically assume the same GPL licensing status from that point in time. The
current version of this license is available at:

  http://www.submm.caltech.edu/~sharc/crush/instruments/scuba2/license.txt

If you do not agree to these terms, you cannot use the proprietary SCUBA-2
modules of CRUSH-2. By declining the terms above, you are also required to 
remove any copies of these modules you may have, immediately after reading this
license agreement.
