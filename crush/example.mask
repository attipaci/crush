#  An example CRUSH mask file -- by Attila Kovacs
#
###############################################################################

# Description: Mask files in CRUSH serve a dual purpose:
# 
#  a. They can be an output of crush tools, such as a source catalog generated 
#     by 'detect', or circular regions selected in 'show'.
# 
#  b. They can be input for CRUSH tools, including a reduction, defining test
#     sources, or regions for flagging, or filter avoidance, or source profile
#     generation (see the 'sources' option in the GLOSSARY, and 'imagetool').
#
# The format is space (or tab) separated columns as follows:
#
#    col 1: Source ID (no spaces)
#    col 2: RA as hh:mm:ss.s[...] (any number of decimals places)
#    col 3: DEC as dd:mm:ss.s[...] (any number of decimal places)
#    col 4: coordinate epoch, e.g. '(J2000.0)', '(B1950.0)', 2000.0, or 1950.0
#    col 5: FWHM or radius (depending whether it defines a point source or a
#           circular region of some radius) in arcsec.
#    col 6+: (optional) Peak flux. (needed only for inserting test sources
#            into reductions). Optionally with uncertainty when used with
#            '+-' and separating spaces. such as '0.983 +- 0.021'.
#    col 7: (optional) Peak flux unit, such as 'Jy/beam'.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are used for comment lines. Empty lines are skipped.


# ID	RA          DEC        epoch      FWHM	[peak (+- dpeak) unit]
# ===========================================================================
3C345	16:42:58.81 39:48:37.1 (J2000.0)  16.0	
3C345A	16:42:58.81 39:48:37.1 (J2000.0)  16.0	1.237 Jy/beam  
3C345B	16:42:58.81 39:48:37.1 (J2000.0)  16.0	1.237 +- 0.013 Jy/beam  

# Thus all lines above are acceptable definitions of 3C345 as a GISMO [2-mm] 
# point source (16.0" FWHM). The first line merely defines the location and 
# size of the source whilei the variants A and B also specify peak fluxes (with
# and without uncertainty), which can be used to add (or remove) sources to 
# (from) the timestream prior to reduction.
