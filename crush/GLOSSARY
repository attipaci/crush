:: 350um		@Instrument: SHARC-2
			Specify that the 350um filter was used (default). This 
			adjuts conversion factors, tau scaling relations for 
			calculating in-band line-of sight opacitites, and beam 
			sizes (see 'sharc2/default.cfg').
			@See: 'jansky', 'tau.<?>', 'beam'.

:: 450um		@Instrument: SHARC-2, SCUBA-2 
			Use if the 450um filter was used to observe with 
			SHARC-2, or to specify 450um imaging with SCUBA-2
			@See: '350um' and '850um'

:: 850um		@Instrument: SHARC-2, SCUBA-2
			Specify that data was taken at 850um with SHARC-2, or
			to reduce the data from the 850um array of SCUBA-2.
			@See: '350um' and '450um'

:: accel		@Alias -> 'correlated.accel-mag'
			@Instrument
			@Advanced
		 	Can be used to enable acceleration response 
			decorrrelation, or to set options for it.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>' for available options.
	
:: aclip=X		@Advanced
			Clip data when the telescope acceleration is above
			X arcsec/s^2. Heavy accelerations can put mechanical
			energy into the detector system, changing the shape of
			the primary, thereby generating bright signals from the 
			varying illumination of the bright atmosphere. Clipping 
			data when there is danger of this happening is a good 
			idea. 
			@See: 'accel' for possible modeling of these signals)

:: alias.<?>		@Advanced
			Use to define convenient shorthands for yourself. 
			Aliases are literal substitutions. Thus:

			    alias.altaz system=horizontal		
			
			can specify 'altaz' to serve as a shorthand for the
			key/value pair 'system=horizontal'. Conditional can also
			be aliased. E.g.:
			
			    alias.final iteration.[last]

			Defines 'final' as a shorthand for 'iteration.[last]'.
			Thus:
			
			    final:smooth=9.0

			is understood as being 

			   iteration.[last] smooth=9.0

			(The colon provides an alternative to a white-space to
			separate the condition from the statement, which is also
			command-line friendly).
			@See: 'altaz', 'final'   

:: altaz		@Alias -> 'system=horizontal' 
			Shorthand for reducing in Alt/Az cordinates.
			@See: 'system' and 'horizontal'.

:: amps			@Alias -> 'correlated.amps'
			@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on amplifier boards, or set options for it.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>' for details on brached options.

:: array		@Alias -> 'correlated.obs-channels'
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on all the radiation-sensitive channels of
			the instrument, or set options for it.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>' for details on brached options.
	
:: azymuth		@Alias -> 'correlated.telescope-x'
			@Instrument: GISMO
			@Advanced
			Remove signals, which are correlated to the azymuth
			movement of the telescope (e.g. superconducting detector
			arrays sensitive to Earth's magnetic field.),
			@See: 'correlated.<?>' for details on brached options.

:: beam=X		Set the instrument beam to X arcseconds.
			@Advanced
			@See: 'resolution'

:: beammap		Effectively the same as 'source.type=beammap', which is
			invoked by a condition, not an alias because aliasing
			would interfere with the similarly named 
			'beammap.process' and 'beammap.writemaps' options.
			Used for reducing beam map data. Instead of making a 
			single map from all pixels, separate maps are created 
			for each pixel (Note, this can chew up some memory if 
			you have a lot of pixels). At the end of the reduction 
			CRUSH determines the actual pixel offsets in the focal 
			plane.
			@See: 'source.type', 'map', 'skydip', 'grid'
	
:: beammap.process	@Advanced
			Specify that beam-maps should undergo the same
			post-processing steps (e.g. smoothing, clipping
			filtering, etc.) that are used for regular map-making.
			When the option is not set, beam-maps are used in their
			raw maximum-likelihood forms.
			@See: 'beammap', 'beammap.writemaps'

:: beammap.writemaps	Beam maps normally only produce the pixel position 
			information. Use this option if you want CRUSH to write
 			individual pixel maps as well, so you can peek at these
			yourself.
			@See: 'beammap', beammap.process'

:: blacklist[=<list>]	Similar to 'forget', except it will not set options 
			even if they are then specified at a later time. This 
			is useful for altogether removing settings from the 
			configuration.
			@Since: 2.01-4
			Without an argument, the command will produce the list
			of all blacklisted settings on the console.
			@See: 'whitelist', 'forget', 'recall', 'remove', 
			      'replace'

:: blank=X		@Expert
			Skip data from modeling over points that have a source
			flux exceeding the signal-to-noise level X. This may
			be useful in reducing the filtering effect around 
			bright peaks. 
			@See: 'clip'.

:: blind=<list>		@Expert
			Specify a list of blind pixels. Use data indeces (e.g.
			backend indeces for APEX) and ranges, in a comma-
			separated form. E.g.:

			   blind 46,70-72,84

			Blind channels may be used by some instruments to
			estimate instrumental signals, such as temperature
			fluctuations (LABOCA). Channels are normally numbered
			from 1 (i.e. not C-style!)
			@See: 'flag'.

:: block=NX,NY		@Instrument: SHARC-2, SCUBA-2
			@Expert
			Specify a correlated block size for higher order 
			sky-noise removal, as two integer pixel numbers (rows 
			and columns) separated by a comma or 'x'. E.g.:

			   block=4x6

			will decorrelate signals on blocks that are 4 columns 
			wide and 6 rows tall (i.e. there will be 16 such blocks
			on the 32x12 SHARC-2 array).
			@See: 'blocks'

:: blocks		@Alias -> correlated.blocks
			@instrument: SHARC-2, SCUBA-2
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on rectangular block regions of the array, 
			as a way to remove higher order sky-noise. As such, it 
			can be used together with, or instead of 'gradients'.
			@See: 'gradients', 'correlated.<?>'

:: boxes		@Alias -> correlated.boxes
			@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on electronic boxes, or set options for it.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>', 'cables', 'squids'

:: bright		Use for bright sources (S/N > ~1000). This setting
			entirely bypasses all filtering to produce a very
			faithful map. The drawback is more noise, but
			that should not be an issue for such a bright guy :-)
			Will invoke 'bright.cfg'.
			@See: 'config', 'faint', 'deep'

:: cables		@Alias -> correlated.cables
			@Instrument: LABOCA, ASZCA
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate channels whose signals are running on the 
			same cables, and which are therefore subject to the 
			same pickups (electromagnetic or microphonic).
			@See: 'correlated.<?>', 'boxes'

:: center		@Deprecated: 2.00-b4
			@See: 'pointing'

:: chopped		Used for specifying a chopped data reduction. Can be
			set manually or automatically (via 'detect.chopped')
			based on the data itself. The key may trigger 
			conditional statements and extra decorrelation steps.
			@See: 'detect.chopped', 'correlated.<?>.trigger'

:: chopper		@Alias -> correlated.chopper-x
			@Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Advanced
			Remove signals that are correlated with chopper 
			movement. The moving secondary mirror changes the 
			telescope illumination, thus producing strong signals 
			when observing under a bright atmosphere. To first 
			order, such signals are linear with chopper 
			displacement. Since most telescopes chop in the 
			horizontal 'x' direction only, the 'chopper' keyword is
			aliased to decorrelation on motion in that direction. 
			When a 2D chopper is used, you should decorrelate in 
			both the 'x' and 'y' directions.
			@See: 'decorrelate.<?>', 'detect.chopped'

:: clip=X		@Expert
			In early generations of the source map, force map
			pixels with flux below signal-to-noise level X to zero.
			This may help getting lesser baselines, and filtering 
			artefacts around the brighter peaks. Often used together
			with 'blank' in the intermediate iterations.
			@See: 'blank', 'iteration.[?]'

:: conditions[=<pattern>]	@Since: 2.01-4
				Check conditional settings in the configuration
			Used without the pattern, it lists all conditionals
			under the current configuration tree. An optional
			pattern can be used to restrict the list to those
			conditions only, which start with the specified pattern.
			E.g.:

			   > crush [...] -condition=despike

			Will lists all conditions that depend on one of the
			despike settings ('despike', 'despike2', or 'despike3')
			Due to the configuration hierarchy, the listing can
			also be produces for subtrees. E.g.:

			   > crush [...] -date.conditions

			will list the conditions residing under the 'date'
			subtree (i.e. conditions originally specified as 
			'date.[...]').
			@See: 'poll', 'blacklist' 

:: config=<filename>	Load the configuration file filename. 
				The file is looked for in the locations in the
				following order:

					1. ./
					
					2. ./<instrument>/

					3. ~/.crush2/

					4. ~/.crush2/<instrument>/

			Whenever a matching file is found its contents are 
			parsed. Because of the ordering, it is convenient to 
			create overriding configurations.
			Thus instrument specific settings can be used to 
			override common defaults, and user specific settings 
			placed in '~/.crush2' can override the distribution 
			defaults. Whenever a configuration is parsed, there is 
			a note of it on the console output so that one always 
			knows which files were read and in what order. E.g. 
			when using
		
			   > crush laboca 12066

			the following configuration files will be loaded in 
			order (provided they exist):

			    {$CRUSH}/default.cfg
			    {$CRUSH}/laboca/default.cfg
			    ~/.crush2/default.cfg
			    ~/.crush2/laboca/default.cfg
				  
			Each successively loaded file may override the options 
			set before it.
			When a matching configuration file is not found in any
			of the standard locations (above), CRUSH will make one
			last attempt to interpret the argument as a standard 
			pathname. This allows users to store and invoke custom 
			configurations anywhere on the file system.
			@See: 'bright', 'faint', 'deep'
	

:: convert		@Instrument: SCUBA-2
			@Since: 2.01-3
			@Advanced
			Just convert all the SDF files to FITS, then exit. 
			Batch conversion is useful if you are going to reduce
			the same dataset many times over (e.g. to optimize
			the reduction settings). You will need the 'ndf2fits'
			option to be configured and working, before batch 
			conversions can be used. The resulting FITS files are
			written to the path defined by 'outpath', or 'datapath'
			(in the above order, depending on which is defined). 
			@See: 'ndf2fits', 'outpath', 'datapath'

:: correlated.<?>	Remove the correlated noise term accross the entire
			array. The <?> stands for the name of the modality on
			which decorrelation is performed. E.g. 'obs-channels', 
			'gradients', 'squids' (ASZCA, GISMO or SABOCA), or 
			'rows' (SHARC-2). 
			This is an effective way of dealing with most 
			atmospheric, and instrumental signals, such as sky 
			noise, ground pickup, temperature fluctuations, 
			electromagnetic or microphonic pickups. The 
			decorrelation of each modality can be further 
			controlled by a number of subkeys (see below). 
			The given decorrelation step must also appear in the
			pipeline 'ordering' before it can be used.
			@See: 'modality', 'ordering'

:: correlated.<?>.nofield	@Expert
				@since: 2.02
			Allows to decouple the gains of the correlated mode 
			from the gain fields stored under the channel (which 
			are initialized from the file specified by 
			'pixeldata'). 
			@See: 'pixeldata', 'source.fixedgains'

:: correlated.<?>.gainrange=min:max	@Expert
					Specify a range of acceptable gains to 
			the given correlated signal <?>, relative to the 
			average gain response of the correlated mode. Channels 
			that exhibit responses outside of this range will be 
			appropriately flagged in the reduction, and ignored in 
			the modeling steps until the flag is revised and 
			cleared in another decorrelation step.
			@See: 'division.<?>.gainflag', 'correlated.<?>.signed'

:: correlated.<?>.nogains	@Advanced
			      	Disable the solving of gains (i.e. channel 
				responses) to the correlated signal <?>.

:: correlated.<?>.nosignals	@Expert
				Disable the solving for correlated signal <?>, 
				whose value stays fixed afterwards.

:: correlated.<?>.phases	@Expert
				@Since: 2.02
			Decorrelated the phase data (e.g. for chopped
			photometry scans) together with the fast samples.
			The same gains are used as for the usual decorrelation
			on the fast samples.

:: correlated.<?>.resolution=X	@Advanced
				Set the time resolution (in seconds) for the 
			decorrelation of <?>. When dealing with 1/f-type 
			signals, you probably want to set this to the 1/f knee 
			time-scale or below if you want optimal sensitivities. 
			Else, you may want to try larger values if you want to 				recover more large-scale emission and you aren't too 
			worried about the loss of sensitivity.
			@See: 'extended'
			
:: correlated.<?>.signed	@Expert
				By default gain responses are allowed to be 
			bidirectional, and flagging affects only those channels
			or pixels, whose absolute gain values fall outside of 
			the specified range. When 'signed' is set, then gains 
			are flagged with the signs also taken into account. 
			I.e., under 'signed', 'gainrange' of '0.3:3.0' would 
			flag pixels with a gain of -0.8, whereas the default 
			behaviour is to tolerate them.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>.gainrange',
			      'correlated.<?>.nogains'

:: correlated.<?>.span		@Expert
				@Since: 2.02
			Make the gains of the correlated modality span scans
			instead of integrations (subscans). You can also
			set this option for all correlated modalities at once
			using the 'gains.span' key.
			@See: 'gains.span', 'correlated.<?>.phases'

:: correlated.<?>.trigger=<key>	@Expert
				You can specify a configuration key that is to 
			serve as a trigger for activation the decorrelation of 
			<?>. This is used, for example to activate the 
			decorrelation of chopper signals, if and when the 
			'chopped' keyword is specified. E.g.:

			   chopper.trigger=chopped

			@See: 'chopper', 'chopped'

:: correlated.*		@Advanced
			You can use wildcards '*' to set options for all
			decorrelation steps at once. E.g.:

			   correlated.*.resolution 1.0
			 
			Sets the time-resolution of all currently defined 
			decorrelation branches (and modalities) to 1 second.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>', 'resolution'

:: datapath=<dir>	Start looking for raw data in directory <dir>. Some
			instruments may also interpret it as a root directory
			in which data may reside some specific hierarchy. E.g.
			in <dir>/<project> for APEX bolometers. Thus, if an
			APEX instrument defines:
				
				datapath /homes/data
				project T-79.F-0002-2007

			then crush will try to find data first in
			'/homes/data', then in '/homes/data/T-79.F-0002-2007'
			This provides a convenient way for accessing 
			hierarchically stored data. See the instrument-
			specific notes for details.
 
:: dataunit=<name>	@Advanced
			Specify the units, in which the data are stored.
			Typically, 'counts' or 'V', or any of their common 
			multiples, such as 'mV', 'uV' or 'pcount' are accepted.
			The conversion from data units to jansky-based units is
	 		set via the 'jansky' option, while the choise of units 
			in the data reduction is set by 'unit'.
			@See: 'unit', 'jansky'

:: date=YYYY-MM-DD	@Instrument: GISMO
			Specify the date of observation for GISMO data, which 
			can be used along with 'object' to help locate scan 
			data using scans numbers (and ranges). The date must be
 			given in the specified format, identical to the one 
			appearing in the standard IRAM scan IDs.
			@See: 'object', 'read'

:: date.[...]		@Advanced
			A way to set date specific conditional statements. 
			Inside the square brackets one can specify a date range 
			in YYYY-MM-DD format, separated by a colon ':' or 
			hyphen(s) '-'. Wildcards '*' are also accepted to 
			specify open ranges. E.g.:

			  date.[2009.12.10--*] instrument.gain=-1000.0

			Can be used to specify an inverted thousand-fold
			instrumental gain starting from Dec 10, 2009.
			@See: 'mjd', 'serial'

:: deep			Use for very faint sources which are not at all 
			detected in single scans, or if you think
			there is too much residual noise (baselines) in your 
			map to your liking. This setting results in the most 
			agressive filtering. Will load the configuration from
			'deep.cfg'. The output map is optimally filtered
			(smoothed) for point sources.
			@See: 'config', 'bright', 'faint'

:: despike		Use despiking. CRUSH allows the use of up to three
	 		different despiking steps, each configurable on its
			own, to specify a despiking method, S/N level and
			flagging criteria. See the various despiking options
			below:

:: despike2		@Advanced
			A second round of despiking.
			@See: despike

:: despike3		@Advanced
			A third round of despiking.
			@See: despike

:: despike.flagcount=N	@Expert
			Tolerate (w/o pixel flagging) up to N spikes up in each
	 		pixel.

:: despike.flagfraction=X	@Expert
				Tolerate (w/o pixel flagging) spikes up to 
			fraction X of the scan frames in each channel.
				
:: despike.framespikes=N	@Expert
				Tolerate up to N spikes per frame.
	
:: despike.level=X	@Advanced
			Despike at an S/N level of X.	

:: despike.method=<name>	@Advanced
				CRUSH offers a choice of despiking methods to 
			choose from. Each of these have their own pros and 
			cons, and may produce different results and side-
			effects in different environments. The following 
			methods are currently available:

			   neighbours  Despike only by comparing neighbouring 
			   	       samples of data from the same channel.

			   absolute    Flag data that deviates by the specified
			   	       S/N level.

			   gradual     Like 'absolute' but proceeds more 
			   	       cautiously, removing only a fraction of
				       most offending spikes at each turn.

			   features    Look for spikes wider than just a sigle 
			   	       sample. The 'width' subkey (below) 
				       the timescale, up to which spikes sought.

			All methods will flag pixels and frames if these have 
			too many spikes. The flagging of spiky channels and 
			frames is controlled by the 'flagcount, 'flagfraction' 
			and 'framespikes' subkeys.
			@See: 'despike.flagcount', 'despike.flagfraction',
			      'despike.framespikes', 'despike.level',
			      'despike.width'

:: despike.width=X	@Expert
			When despiking using the 'features' method, spikes up 
			to X second in width will be sought.
				
:: detect.chopped	@Advanced
			Try determine from the data itself if the chopper was 
			used, and set the 'chopped' flag accordingly. This can 
			be used to trigger the actication of specific reduction
			steps for chopped data.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>.trigger'

:: division.<?>=<list> 	@Expert
			Specify a new pixel division <?> from a list of pixel 
			groups, separated by commas. For example, if the pixel 
			groups 'my-pixels-1' and 'my-pixels-2' were defined 
			(via 'group.<?>') then the line

			   division.my-division my-pixels-1,my-pixels-2
			   
			creates a division from these two groups. For every
			division created this way, CRUSH will also create a
			correlated modality with the same name.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>', group.<?> 

:: division.<?>.id=<ID>	@Expert
			Specify a designated ID for the pixel division <?>. 
			This short ID will be printed on the console output, 
			whenever the decorrelation step on the modality <?> is 
			performed in the reduction.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>'

:: division.<?>.gainfield=<name>	@Expert
					You can also specify the name of an 
					existing JAVA double field inside the
			pixel class of the given instrument to serve the gains
			for the decorrelation of <?>. Unless 
			'correlated.<?>.nogains' is also specified, these gains
			will be determined and overwriten each time the 
			decorrelation takes place.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>.nogains'

:: division.<?>.gainflag=N	@Expert
				Specify a gain flagging pattern to use when 
				flagging outlying gains in the decorrelation 
			step of <?>. Gain flags are normally one bit in a 
			4-byte integer, and can be specified using octal ('0' 
			prefix) or hexadecimal ('0x' prefix) numbers, and 
			regular integers. You should be careful not to 
			interfere with existing flags, many of which may be
			hardcoded in the JAVA source. Use with extreme caution,
			if you must...
			@See: 'correlated.<?>.gainrange'

:: downsample=X		@Advanced
			Downsample the data by a factor of N. At times the
			raw data is sampled at unnecessarily high frequencies.
			By donwsampling, you can ease the memory requirement
			and speed up the reduction. You can also set the value
			to 'auto' (default), in which case an optimal 
			downsampling rate is determined based on the typical 
			scanning speeds, s.t. the loss of information will be 
			insignificant due to unintended smearing of the data.

:: drifts=X		@Advanced
			Filter low frequencies below the characteristic 
			timescale of X seconds. An effective way of dealing 
			with 1/f noise.
			You can also use 'auto' to determine the filtering
			timescales automatically, based on 'sourcesize', 
			scanning speeds, and instrument 'stability' time-scales.
			@See: 'sourcesize', 'stability', 'offsets
	
:: drifts.method=<name>	@Advanced
			Choose the method, with which drifts are removed. The 
			choice is between 'blocks' or 'fft'. The former 
			estimates and removes drifts from the timestreams in 
			consecutive time windows (i.e. blocks) of data. This is
			very fast, and scales linearly with data size. The 
			'fft' method implements a spectral lowpass filter, with
			the same characteristic timescale as the other method. 
			It is slower, and its computation requirement scales 
			with N log N.

:: ecliptic		@Alias -> system=ecliptic
			Reduce using ecliptic coordinates (for mapping).
			@See: 'system', 'altaz', 'equatorial'

:: elevation-response   @Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Expert
			Load and use an lookup table for the elevation 
			dependent forward efficiency of the telecscope. The 
			table is an ASCII file, as specified by Darren Dowell, 
			and is available from the SHARC-2 web-site. CRUSH 
			contains copies of the available tables and is 
			configured to use them as needed.

:: epoch=X		@Instrument: GISMO
			Normally the coordinate epoch, in which the equatorial 
			source coordinates are expressed, is stored in the data.
			However, for GISMO runs 1 and 2, this information was 
			handled incorrectly. This option provides the means to 
			correct that. The value can specify a year (e.g. 
			1950.0, or 2000.0), or a proper epoch designation 
			(e.g. B1950, or J2000). IRAM uses J2000 for static 
			sources and the current epoch for solar system objects.

:: equatorial		@Alias -> system=equatorial
			Reduce using equatorial coordinates (for mapping).
			@See: 'system', 'altaz'

:: estimator=<type>	@Advanced
			'median' or 'maximum-likelihood' estimators to use in 
			deriving signal models. 'median' estimators are less 
			sensitive to the presence of bright sources in the 
			data, therefore it is the default for when 'bright' is 
			specified (see 'bright.cfg'), and for some instruments 
			(e.g. GISMO).
			When medians are used, the corresponding models are 
			reported on the console output in []'s...
			(see the Console Output section of the README).
			@See: 'gains.estimator', 'weighting.method'

:: exposureclip=X  	@Advanced
			Flag (clip) map pixels whose relative time coverage
			is less than the specified value X. This is helpful for
			discarding the underexposed noisy edges of the map.
			@See: 'noiseclip', 'clip'

:: excessload=X		@Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Expert 
			SHARC-2 can determine a line-of-sight opacity based on 
			the total-power response of its detectors. However, for 
			this to work well, all sources of optical loading on 
			the detectors must be understood. The load curves (see 
			'response') were determined at one time only, and 
			therefore this flag provides the means to specify a
			different optical loading environment from then, as an
			excess optical load (in Kelvins).
			@See: 'response', 'tau.<?>'

:: extended		Try to better preserve extended structures. This
			setting can be used alone or in combination with
			a brightness options. The fainter settings the more 
			difficult it is to recover extended emission. For 
			bright structures recovery up to FOV (or beyond!) 
			should be possible, while for faint structures ~1/4 FOV
			to ~FOV scales are maximally obtainable (see more on 
			this in the README).
  			@See: 'sourcesize', 'bright', 'faint', 'deep'

:: faint		Use with faint sources (S/N < ~30) when the
			source is faint but still visible in a single scan. 
			This setting applies some more aggressive filtering of 
			the timestreams, and extended structures. It invokes 
			'faint.cfg'.
			@See: 'bright', 'deep'

:: fazo			@Instrument: SHARC-2, GISMO
			An alternative to 'center' for providing pointing 
			corrections. As opposed to 'center', which specifies 
			incremental corrections, this option takes an absolute 
			AZ pointing offset (i.e. FAZO at the CSO) which should 
			have been the correct one (as opposed to the value used
			by the antenna computer during the observations).
			@See: 'fzao', 'center'

:: febe			@Instrument: APEX
			@Expert
			Defines the frontend-backend combination to use. 
			E.g. for LABOCA, this would be set to 'LABOCA-ABBA'.

:: final:key=value	@Alias -> iteration.[last]
			When used on the command line, a ':' can be used as
			a sepatation between the abbreviated condition and its
			statement. E.g.:

			   > crush [...] -final:smooth=beam

			to specify beam smoothing in the last iteration.

:: flag=<list>		Specify a list of backend channels that ought to be 
			ignored for the successively read scans. Can use pixel
			numbers (i.e. APEX backend indexes) and ranges. E.g.:

			   flag 5-10,12,33-37
			   
			Indeces normally start at 1 (i.e. not C-style!).
			@See: 'noslim', 'blind' 

:: forget=<list>...	Forget the priorly set values for the listed options 
			as if they were never defined. E.g. 
		     		
			   forget=outpath

			will unset the 'outpath' option. You can specify more 
			than one options as a comma-separated list. E.g.
	
			   forget=outpath,project
				
			Will unset both the 'outpath' and 'project' options.	
			Forgotten values may be 'recall'-ed.
			Additionally, 'forget' can be used to clear all
			conditionals or all blacklisted settings, if the
			argument list contains the values 'conditions' or 
			'blacklist', respectively.
			@See: 'recall', 'blacklist', 'remove'

:: frames=<from>-<to>   @Advanced
			Read only frames <from>-<to> from the data. Maybe
			useful for quick peeks at the data without processing
			the full scan, or when a part of the data is corrupted.

:: fzao			@Instrument: SHARC-2, GISMO
			Specify a zenith pointing offset.
			@See: 'fazo'

:: gain=X     		@Expert
			Specify an instrument gain of X from the detector stage 
			(or fixed signal stage) to the readout. Many 
			instruments may automatically determine the relevant 
			gain based on their data headers. For others, the gains
			may have to be adjusted by hand, especially if they are
			changing. Upon reading the scans, CRUSH will divide all
			data by the specified value, to bring all scans to a 
			comparable signal level. Conversions to 'jansky' are 
			referenced to such gain-scaled data.
			@See: 'jansky', 'dataunit', 'scale'

:: gainnoise		@Expert
			Add noise to the initial gains. There isn't much use
			for this option, other than it allows to check the
			robustness of the reduction on the initial gain 
			assumption. Since gains are usually measured in the
			reduction itself, typical reductions should not depend
			a lot on the intitial gain values.
			@See: 'uniform'

:: gains		@Advanced
			Solve for pixel gains based on their response to the
			correlated noise (above). If not specified, then
			all decorrelation steps will proceed without gain 
			solution. A model-by-model control is offered by the
			'correlated.<?>.nogains' option.
			@See: 'gains.estimator', 'correlated.<?>.nogains'

:: gains.estimator=<type>	@Advanced
				Specify the type of estimator ('median' or
				'maximum-likelihood') to be used for estimating
			pixel gains to correlated signals.
			@See: 'estimator', 'correlated.<?>'
			

:: gains.span		@Expert
			@Since: 2.02 
			Derive gains for all correlated modalities for entire
			scans, rather than separately for each integration
			(subscan). Most scans contain just one integration, and
			multiple integrations are often merged into one upon 
			reading. However, for chopped photometry observations, 
			the nod phases remain in separate subscans, and this 
			option makes the gains apply to all nod phases in a 
			scan, rather than separate gains for each nod phase.
			Alternatively, the gain spans can be controlled 
			individually, per modality, via the 
			'correlated.<?>.span' keys.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>.span', 'phases'

:: galactic 		@Alias -> system=galactic
			Reduce using new galactic coordinates (for mapping).
			@See: 'system', 'equatorial', 'altaz'

:: gradients		@Alias -> correlated.gradients
			@Advanced
			Shorthand for the decorrelation of gradients accross the
			detector array. Such gradients can occue as a result of
			spatial sky-noise, or as temperature variation across 
			the detectors.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>', 'blocks'			
	
:: grid=X		set the map pixelization to X arcsec. Pixelization
			smaller than 2/5 beam is recommended. The default is
			~1/5 beam pixelization.

:: group.<?>=<list>     @Expert
			Specify a list of channels, by index, that belong
			to a group with name <?>. The list can contain
			comma separated list of indeces (starting with 1) and
			ranges. E.g.:

			  group.my-group 10-20,45,50-60
			    	
			defines a group named 'my-group' from the specified
			channels.
			@See: 'division'

:: he3=<source>		@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Advanced
			Correct time-streams for He3 temperature fluctuations. 
			<source> specifies the source of the He3 data, which 
			can be 'thermistor' or 'blinds'. The use of blind 
			bolometers is quicker and preferred, unless you 
			specifically wish to use the 'thermistors'.

::  he3.gains		@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Expert
			Specifies that rather than correcting for temperature 
			fluctuations, the thermistor and bolometer data should 
			be used to calculate appropriate temperature gains. 
			This option should only be used on skydip scans with 
			the shutter closed (i.e. only temperature signals 
			without sky). Additionally 'forget=source' should be 
			used to disable source modeling for such data.

:: he3.maxrms=X		@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Expert
			Define the maximum RMS temperature variation (Kelvin)
			over the duration of a scan. When a scan has variation
			larger than this limit, it will be dropped from the
			reduction. 
	
:: horizontal		@Alias -> system=horizontal
			Reduce in horizontal coordinates (for mapping).
			This is often useful for determining pointing offsets
			or for beam mapping.
			@See: 'system', 'center', 'beammap', 'fazo', 'fzao'

:: indexing		@Expert
			Allows the use of data indexing to speed up coordinate
			calculations for mapping. Without indexing the map
			coordinates are calculated at each mapping step. This 
			can be slow because of the complexity of the spherical
			projections, which often require several complex math
			evaluations. With indexing enabled, the calculations
			are performed only once, and the relevant data is stored
			for reuse. However, the storage of indexes more or
			less doubles the memory requirement of CRUSH. Thus, 
			'indexing' may be disabled for very large reductions.
			Alternatively, one may control the amount of memory such
			indexes may use, via the 'indexing.saturation' option.
			@See: 'indexing.saturation', 'grid'

:: indexing.saturation=X 	@Expert
				Specify the maximum fraction X of the total
				available memory that can be filled before
			indexing is automatically disabled. Given a typically 
			20% overhead during reduction, values below 0.8 are
			recommended to avoid overflows. 
			@See: 'indexing'

:: invert		Invert signals. This setting may be useful in creating 
			custom jackknifes, where the user wishes to retain 
			control over which scans are inverted.
			@See: 'gain', 'scale', 'jackknife'

:: iteration.[N]	Use as a condition to delay settings until the Nth
			iteration. E.g.

			   iteration.[3] smooth halfbeam

			or 

			   > crush [...] -iteration.[3]smooth=halfbeam [...]
			 
			to specify half-beam smoothing starting from the 3rd
			iteration.
			@See: 'iteration.[?]'

			
:: iteration.[last]    	Specify settings that should be interpreted only at the 
			beginning of the last iteration.
			@See: 'iteration.[?]'
	
:: iteration.[last-N]  	Activate settings N iterations before the last one. 
			E.g.
			    
			    iteration.[last-2] forget=clip

			Disables clipping two iterations before the last one.	
			@See: 'iteration.[?]'

:: iteration.[X%]	Activate settings as a percentage X of the total
			number of iterations (as set by 'rounds'). E.g.
			
			    iteration.[50%] forget clip

			can be used to disable the S/N clipping of the source 
			map half way through the reduction.
			@See: 'iteration.[?]'

:: iteration.[?]	Apply settings at the beginning of specific iterations. 
			Because of the flexible syntax, the same iteration can 
			be referred to in different ways. Consider a reduction 
			with 10 rounds. Then,

			    iteration.[5] smooth 5.0
			    iteration.[50%] smooth 10.0
			    iteration.[last-5] smooth beam

			can all be used to define what happens in the 5th
			iteration. CRUSH will parse these conditionals in the 
			above order: first the explicit iteration settings then 
			those relative to the reduction length, and finally the 
			settings relative to the end of the reduction. Thus, in 
			the above example the beam smoothing will always 
			override the other two settings.
			@See: 'iteration.[N]', 'iteration.[X%]', 
			      'iteration.[last]', 'iteration.[last-N]'


:: jackknife		Jackkniving is a useful technique to produce accurate 
			noise maps from large datasets. When the option is used 
			the scan signals are randomly inverted, s.t. the source 
			signals in large datasets will tend to cancel out, 
			leaving one with pure noise maps.
			The sign inversion is truly random, s.t. repeated runs
			with the 'jackknife' flag will produce a different 
			jackknife every time. If you want more control over 
			which scans are inverted, consider using the 'invert' 
			flag instead.
			@See: 'invert', 'scramble'


:: jansky=X		Specify the calibration factor from data units to Jy.
			@See: 'dataunit', 'gain', 'jansky.inverse'.

:: jansky.inverse	When used, the 'jansky' definition is inverted to mean
			Jy to data unit. This used to be the old definition used
			in crush-1.xx and minicrush.
			@See: 'jansky'

:: log			@Advanced
			@Since: 2.03
			Log the scans after the reduction. (Similar logging
			is available without reducing at all via the 'obslog'
			key). You can control what quantities are logged and
			in what format via the 'log.format' key. Please refer
			to the README for details on how the logging works and
			what you many log and how.
			@See: 'obslog', 'log.file', 'log.format', 
			      'log.conflict'

:: log.conflict=<value>		@Expert
				@Since:2.03	
			Since log files are locked to their format, a changing
			for format without specifying a new log file will 
			cause a conflict. Use this key to determine how such
			conflicts are resolved. The following values are
			permitted:

			   overwrite	Delete the previous log file, and 
					create a new one with the same name
					using the new format.

			   version	Try find an alternative version of the
					log file (with .1, .2 ... extension
					attached to the file name) in the new
					format, or create a new such version.
			
			The default behaviour is to assume versioning, in order
			to preserve prior logs.
			@See: 'log.file'

:: log.file=<path>	@Advanced
			@Since:2.03
			Set the file to which reductions will be logged. You
			can use the usual path specifications of CRUSH, 
			including shorthands (such as '~') and environment
			variables (such as {$HOME}). The actual log file used
			may be a sub-version of the specified file (with
			.1, .2 ... extension added) if the conflict policy
			set by 'log.conflict' is to use versioning.
			@See: 'log', 'log.format', 'log.conflict'

:: log.format=		@Expert
			@Since: 2.03
			Specify the format of the log file. You can control 
			what quantities are logged and how they should appear.
			Please refer to the README for more details on the
			available options
			@See: 'log', 'log.file', 'log.format'

:: maitau.fallback=<type>	@Instrument: SHARC-2
				@Advanced
			Define which tau value to use in case the MaiTau lookup
			fails. The possible values are:

			   direct 	  Calculate tau from the total-power
			       		  loading of the detectors

			   225GHz	  Use the 225GHz tipper value.

			   350um	  Use the 350um tipper value.

			   pwv		  Use precipitable water vapor.

			   sharc2	  Use the value specified by tau.sharc2

			Other than the 'direct' flag, the values may be 
			specified with the corresponding tau settings.
			@See: 'maitau.server', 'tau.225GHz', 'tau.350um',
			      'tau.sharc2'

:: maitau.server=IP	@Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Expert
			Specify the MaiTau server to use, either as an IP
			address, or server name. This should probably be set to 
			'agn.caltech.edu', or to the equivalent 
			'fangorn.submm.caltech.edu'. MaiTau is a server-based
			lookup of the CSO opacities, based on dailly polynomial
			fits to the measured 225GHz and 350um tipper data. The
			polynomials smooth out short-term fluctuations and 
			measurement errors, providing a smoothly varying 
			function of tau with time. When using MaiTau, CRUSH 
			will try use the 350um fit, and then the 225GHz fit (if 
			available), from which it calculates an appropriate 
			in-band zenith tau value.
			@See: 'tau.<?>.a', 'tau.<?>.b'

:: mappingfraction=X   	@Advanced
			Specify a minimum fraction of pixels in the array
			that have to remain unflagged for creating a map
			from the scan. If too many pixels are flagged in the
			reduction, it may be a sign of bigger problems, 
			questioning the reliability of the scan data. It is best
			to skip over problematic scans in order to minimize 
			their impact on the mapping.
			@See: 'mappingpixels'

:: mappingpixels=N	@Advanced
			Specify a minimum number of pixel, which have to
			be unflagged by the reduction in order for the scan to
			contribute to the mapping step
			@See: 'mappingfraction'

:: map.size=X,Y		@Advanced
			Explicitly set the size of the mapped are, centered on 
			the source to and X by Y arcseconds rectangle. Normally,
			the map size is automatically calculated to contain all
			of the data. One may want to restrict mapping to smaller
			regions (outside of which, there should be no bright
			sinals). The letter 'x' may also be used instead of the
			comma to separate the dimensions. E.g.:

			   map.size=300x200

			will restrict mapping to a 300" by 200" are (in the 
			chosen coordinate system of the mapping), centered on
			the nominal source coordinates.
			@See: 'system'

:: mjd.[...]		@Advanced
			Specify settings that are conditionally activated if and
			when the MJD of the scan falls within the specified 
			range inside the square brackets. Wildcards '*' can be 
			used to indicate open ended ranges. E.g.:

			       mjd.[*-54230.25] jansky=5.0

			specifies that up until 6:00 UT on 10.05.2007, the 
			conversion factor of 5.0 data units per Jy should be
			used.
			@See: 'date.[...]', 'serial.[...]'

:: mux			@Alias -> decorrelate.mux
			@Instrument: SHARC-2, GISMO, SCUBA-2
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on MUXes, or set options for it.
			@See: 'decorrelate.<?>'

:: name=		Specify the output image file name, relative to the
			directory specified by 'outpath'. When not given
			minicrush will chose a file name based on the source
			name and scan number(s), which is either

				<sourcename>.<scanno>.fits

			or
	
				<sourcename>.<firstscan>-<lastscan>.fits

			For mapping. Other source model types (e.g. skydips
			or beam maps) may have different default naming 
			conventions.
			@See: 'outpath'

:: ndf2fits=<path>	@Instrument: SCUBA-2
			@Since: 2.01-1
			SCUBA-2 data is released in a proprietary SDF format,
			which is not well documented for direct use. Instead,
			the StarLink software suite provides utilities for
			manipulating such files. Among these it provides a
			conversion utility 'ndf2fits' that can translate SDF
			files into FITS files readable by CRUSH. You can do 
			the conversion yourself using the 'proexts' option.
			Or, you can let CRUSH convert the input files on-the-
			fly, as necessary. This option serves to specify the
			full path to the ndf2fits utility, including the
			executable name. E.g.:
			
			  ndf2fits=/usr/local/starlink/convert/ndf2fits

			Clearly, you will need a functional installation
			of the Starlink software or, at minimumm it conversion
			package, for this option to work.
			
:: noiseclip=X		Flag (clip) map pixel with a noise level that is more
			than X times higher than the deepest covered parts
			of the map.
			@See: 'exposureclip', 'clip'

:: nogaps[=JSharc]	@Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Advanced
			Terminate the reading of the data at the first 
			gap. During the early SHARC-2 runs when JSharc was used 
			for the acquisition of the data, there was an 
			occasional damaging timing bug resultuing from the 
			wraparound of an internal buffer. The bug manifested in
			a sudden jump in the timestamps, making it relatively 
			easy to diagnose if this happened during the scan.
			The optional argument 'JSharc' restricts the gap 
			termination to data obtained using 'JSharc' alone
			(default).

:: noresistors		@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Expert
			Do not use the resistor channels in the decorrelation of
			electrinic signals, such as 'boxes', 'cables' and 
			'amps'. In LABOCA several of the readout channels are 
			connected not to light-sensitive detectors, but to 
			fixed resistors. While these are not sensitive to 
			radiation or temperature the channels will still be 
			subject to electronic pickup. Therefore, the default is
			to use these channels when decorrelating signals, which
			are thought to originate within the electronics. This 
			option can be used to overrride this behavior, and 
			restrict all decorrelation steps to detector channels 
			only.
			@See: 'boxes', 'cables', 'amps'
		
:: noslim		@Expert
			After reading the scans, CRUSH will discard data from
			from channels flagged with a  harware problem (any bit 
			in 0xFF), to free up memory, and to speed up the 
			reduction. This option overrides this behaviour, and 
			retains all channels for the reduction, whether these 
			are used or not.

:: object=<name>	@Instrument: GISMO
			Can be used to help locate GISMO data with scan numbers
			when used together with the 'datapath' and 'date' 
			options.
			E.g.:
			
			  > crush [...] -datapath=. -object=Mars \
			    -date=2010-04-15 12-14

		 	Will reduce Mars scans 12 to 14 from Apr 15, 2010. The
			object name is case-sensitive!
			@See: 'datapath', 'date'

:: obslog		@Advanced
			@Since: 2.03
			Log the scans immediately after reading, and without
			reducing them at all. (Similar logging is available 
			post reduction via the 'log' key). Please refer to the 
			README for details on how the logging works and what 
			you may log and how.
			@See: 'log', 'obslog.file', 'obslog.format', 
			      'obslog.conflict'

:: obslog.conflict=<value>	@Expert
				@Since:2.03	
			Since log files are locked to their format, a changing
			for format without specifying a new log file will 
			cause a conflict. Use this key to determine how such
			conflicts are resolved. Please refer to 'log.conflict'
			for details.
			@See: 'log.conflict', 'obslog.file'

:: obslog.file=<path>	@Advanced
			@Since:2.03
			Set the file to which scans will be logged. Refer to
			'log.file' for details.
			@See: 'log.file', 'obslog.format', 'obslog.conflict'

:: obslog.format=	@Expert
			@Since: 2.03
			Specify the format of the obslog file. You can control 
			what quantities are logged and how they should appear.
			Please refer to the README for more details on the
			available options
			@See: 'obslog', 'obslog.file', 'obslog.format'

:: offsets		@Advanced
			Remove the residual DC offsets from the bolometer 
			signals (ignored when 'drifts' below is also 
			specified.)
			@See: 'drifts'

:: ordering=a,b,c	@Advanced
			Specify the order of pipeline elements as a comma
			separated list of keys.
			@See: 'offsets', 'drifts', 'weighting', 'despike'
			      'source', 'decorrelate.<?>', 'whiten',
			      'time-weighting'

:: ortho		@Instrument: PolKa
			Specify that the orthogonal (a.k.a vertical) analyzer 
			was used for taking the data. Specifying the analyzer is
			important for recovering the polarization information.
			Currently the analyzer position is not recorded in the
			data files, although the plan is to have this capability
			in the future. Currently, therefore, this option is
			necessary to distinguish between the two analyzer grids.

:: outpath=<path>	Specify the output path, where all CRUSH output will be 
			written (including maps etc.). Path names follow the
			usual rules (See 'Basic Configuration' section in the
			README), and can use '~' to refer to the home 
			directories or to environment variables in {} brackets 
			with a $ sign.
			E.g.

				outpath={$HOME}/images

			in UNIX specifies the 'images' subdirectory inside a
			user's home.

:: pcenter=row,col	@Instrument: SHARC-2, GISMO
			@Advanced
			Defines the pointing center used, in terms of the
			instrument pixel row and colum coordinates. Pixel 1,1
			designates the top-left corner of the array in 
			horizontal (AZ/EL) or equivalent Nasmyth coordinates. 
			Columns increase to the right, while row numbers 
			increase downward. Thus, the center of the 
			SHARC-2 array is 6.5,16.5, while the center of GISMO is 
			8.5,4.5. The 'pcenter' option is not used if the pixel 
			positions are loaded from an RCP data file, instead of 
			being calculated (since a rectangular grid can no 
			longer be assumed).
			@See: 'rcp', 'rcenter', 'pixelsize', 'rotate'

:: phases		@Expert
			@Since: 2.02
			Decorrelate also the phase data (e.g. for chopped 
			observations) for all correlated modes. Alternatively
			phase decorrelation can be turned on individually for
			modalities using the 'correlated.<?>.phases' options.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>.phases', 'gains.span'
			
:: pins			@Alias -> correlated.pins
			@Instrument: GISMO, SCUBA-2
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on readout address lines (across the MUXes)
			or set options for it.
			@See: 'decorrelate.<?>', 'pins.group', 'mux'

:: pins.group=N		@Instrument: GISMO
			@Expert
			Based on the 'pins' alias for GISMO, it defines a 
			grouping of N neighbouring address lines. For each MUX,
			there are 32 address lines, which are read out 
			sequentially in the time-domain multiplexing scheme. 
			Thus,

			   pins.group=4
			   
			will group the address lines 1-4, 5-8, ..., 29-32 
			together across all MUXes, thus increasing the number 
			of channels in each group. The decorrelation of address
			lines using the 'pins' option will take place on these 
			groups.
			@See: 'pins', 'mux'

:: pixeldata=<filename>	@Expert
			Specifies a pixel data file, providing initial
			gains, weights and flags for the detectors,
			and possible other information as well depending on the
			specific instrument. Such files can be produced via the
			'write.pixeldata' option (in addition to which you
			may want to specify 'forget=pixeldata' s.t. flags are
			determined without prior bias).
			@See: 'gainnoise', 'uniform', 'flag', 'blind'

:: pixelsize=X,Y	@Instrument: SHARC-2, GISMO, P-ArTeMiS
			@Expert
			Specify the size of rectangular pixels in a grid. This
			is used for calculating pixel positions on a rectangular
			grid. The information is ignored when positions are
			loaded from an RCP data file (as a regular grid can no 
			nonger be assumed).
			@See: 'rcp', 'pcenter', 'rcenter'

:: point		@Since: 2.00-b4
			This is a convenience key for triggering settings for
			reducing pointing scans. Currently, it invokes
			'iteration.[last] pointing=suggest', i.e. suggesting 
			pointing corrections in the last iteration.
			@See: 'pointing', 'pointing.method', 'fazo', 'fzao'

:: pointing=<value>	@Since: 2.00-b4
			Specify pointing corrections, or the way these
			should be derived. The following values are 
			accepted:			 
	
			   x,y		Specify relative pointing offsets as 
					comma-separated valutes (in arcseconds) 
					in the system of the telescope mount. 
					I.e., these should be horizontal
					offsets for ground-based telescopes 
					with an Alt/AZ mount. 
					Some instruments may allow more ways
					to specify pointing corrections (E.g.
					'fazo' and 'fzao' for SHARC-2).

			   suggest	Suggest pointing offsets (at the end
					of the reduction) from the scan itself.
					This is only suitable when reducing 
					compact pointing sources with 
					sufficient S/N to be clearly visible in
					single scans.

			@See: 'point', 'fazo', 'fzao'

:: pointing.method=<value>	@Since: 2.00-b4
				@Expert		
			Specify the method used for obtaining positions of 
			pointing sources. Currently 'centroid' (default) and 
			'peak' are supported. This option also controls how 
			pixel position information (RCP) is calculated for 
			'beammap' reductions.
			@See: 'point', 'beammap'

:: pointing.significance=X	@Since: 2.00-0
				@Expert
			Set the significance (S/N) level required for pointing
			sources to provide a valid pointing result. If the
			option is not set, a value of 5.0 is assumed.

:: poll[=<key>]		Whenever unsure what options are set at any given stage,
			you can poll the settings. Without an additional 
			argument it will list all currently defined setting to 
			the standard output. When an argument is specified it 
			will list the configuration settings that start with 
			the specified string. E.g.

			    > crush [...] -poll=despike
	
			will list all despiking options (e.g. all settings 
			under the 'despike', 'despike2', and 'despike3' 				branches) that have been defined prior to the 					invokation of the '-poll' command.
			Due to the hierarchical nature of the configurations
			you can also selectively poll settings under subtrees
			of the configuration. E.g.:

			   > crush [...] -source.poll

			Will lists all source model related settings stored
			under the 'source' subtree.
			@See: 'conditions', 'blacklist'

:: positions.smooth=X	@Expert
			Specify that the telescope encoder data should be
			smoothed with a time window X seconds wide, in 
			order to minimize the effects on encoder noise on the
			calculation of scanning speeds and accelerations, based
			on which data may be discarded, and optimal downsampling
			rates are determined.
			@See: 'aclip', 'vclip', 'downsample'

:: project=<id>    	@Instrument: APEX
			Some instruments (e.g. APEX bolometers) may require a 
			project ID to be set in order to locate scans by serial 
			number. Use capitalized form when defining APEX 
			projects. E.g.,

                              project T-79.F-0002-2007


:: projection=		Choose a map projection to use. The following 
			projections are supported:

				SIN  --  Slant Orthographic
				TAN  --  Gnomonic
				ZEA  --  Zenithal Equal Area
				SFL  --  Sanson-Flamsteed
				MER  --  Mercator
				CAR  --  Plate-Carree
				AIT  --  Hammer-Aitoff
				GLS  --  Radio (aka Global Sinusoidal)

:: radec		@Alias -> system=equatorial
			Reduce using equatorial coordinates (for mapping).
			(Default)
			@See: 'system', 'altaz'

:: range=min:max	@Expert
			@Since: 2.03
			Set the acceptable range of data (in the units it is
			stored). Values outside of thi range will be flagged,
			and pixels that are consistent offenders will be
			removed from the reduction (as set by 
			'range.flagfraction').
			@See: 'dataunit', 'range.flagfraction', 'range.auto'	

:: range.auto		@Expert
			@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Since: 2.03
			Set the ADC range automatically using the actual 
			backend gain setting
			@See: 'range'

:: range.flagfraction=X		@Expert
				@Since: 2.03
			Specify the maximum fraction of samples for which a
			channel can be out of range (as set by 'range') before
			that channel is flagged and removed from the reduction.
			@See: 'range'

:: rcenter=dX,dY	@Instrument: SHARC-2	
			@Expert
			Specify a rotation center, in the coordinate system of
			the array (AZ,EL or Nasmyth coordinates). Works 
			similarly to 'pcenter'
			@See: 'pcenter'

:: rcp=<filename>	@Advanced
			Use the RCP file from <filename>. The usual rules of
			path specification apply (see the 'Basic Configuration' 
			section of the README.). The file should conform to the
			standard IRAM or APEX RCP specs containing the 
			information in ASCII columns. RCP files can be produced 
			by the 'beammap' option, from scans, which move a 
			bright point source over all pixels.
			For rectangular arrays, pixel positions can also be 
			calculated on a regular grid using 'pixelsize' and 
			'pcenter'
			@See: 'beammap', 'pixelsize', 'pcenter' 

:: rcp.center=x,y	@Advanced
			Define the center RCP position at x,y in arcseconds.
			Centering takes place immediately after the parsing
			of RCP data.
			@See: 'rcp'

:: rcp.gains		@Advanced
			Use gains from the RCP files. Otherwise gains may 
			come from the 'pixeldata' file, or assume default
			values, such as 'uniform'.
			@See: 'rcp'

:: rcp.rotate=X		@Advanced
			Rotate the RCP positions by X degrees (counter 
			clockwise). Rotations take place after centering (if
			specified).
			@See: 'rcp'

:: rcp.zoom=X		@Advanced
			Zoom (rescale) the RCP position data by the scaling
			factor X. Rescaling takes place after the centering
			(if defined).	
			@See: 'rcp'

:: read=<list>		Read the scans in the list. The list can be a comma, or
			space-separated list of arguments, which can be contain
			the following types of arguments:
			
			  <filename>	Read the scan data from <filename>, 
			  		which can be either a fully specified 
					path, or relative to 'datapath'. 

			  N		Read scan number N. May need additional
			  		options such as 'project' (APEX) or
					'date' and 'object' (GISMO) to be set in
					order to locate the data in a filesystem
					hierarchy.

			  from-to	A hyphen '-' separated range of scan 
			  		numbers (inclusive). Same considerations
					apply as above.

			In all cases, the 'read' key can be omitted on the 
			command  line, where it suffices to list the arguments 
			with white spaces, without any option key. E.g.:

			 > crush [...] myscan.fits 11564 12067-12071

			@See: 'datapath', @APEX:'project', @GISMO:'date',
			      @GISMO:'object'


:: recall=<option>	Undoes 'forget', and reinstates the <option> to its 
			old value.
			@See: 'forget'	

:: remove=<option>	Similar to 'forget', but removes the entire branch. 
			Thus '-remove=despike' unsets:

				despike
				despike.level
				despike.method
				despike.flagfraction
				...

			Branches can be reinstated to their prior state using 
			the 'restore' command.
			@See: 'forget', 'restore'

:: reservecpus=N	Instruct crush NOT to use N number of CPU cores of the 
			machine. By default crush will try to use all 
			processing cores in your machine for maximum 
			performance. This option allows to modify this behavior 
			according to need. 
			Note, that at least 1 CPU will always be used by crush, 
			independent of this setting. The number of actual 
			parallel threads will be the smaller of the allowed 
			number of CPUs and the number of scans processed.


:: resolution=X		@Advanced
			Define the resolution of the instrument. For single-
			color imaging arrays, this is equivalent to 'beam', 
			with X specifying the instrument's main beam FWHM in 
			arcsec. Other instruments (like heterodyne receivers) 
			may interpret 'resolution' differently.
			@See: 'beam'

:: response=<filename>	@Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Expert
			Specify the <filename> containing the pixel 
			loading information, based on which in-band 
			line-of-sight opacities may be calculated.
			@See: 'response.calc', 'tau', 'tau.<?>'

:: response.calc	@Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Expert
			Allows the recalculation of pixel responses, based on an
			initial 'response' provided in a file, and a 'tau' 
			value. Scans on very faint or deep-field sources are 
			most suited for such recalculations. Use this option 
			only if you really understand what it is meant to do.
			@See: 'response', 'tau', 'tau.<?>'

:: restore=<option>	Undoes the 'remove' option, reinstating the <option> 
			tree to its prior state.
			@See: 'remove'

:: rot0			@Instrument: SHARC-2
			@Expert
			Specifies the reference (zero point) of the rotator (if
			available). This option applies only for the early 
			SHARC-2 runs, when the instrument was still mounted on 
			the Cassdegrain platform. The values should be correcly
			configured in the default SHARC-2 configuration 
			('sharc2/default.cfg'), and there should be no reason 
			for the user to change these settings...
			@See: 'rotation'

:: rotation		@Advanced
			Define the instrument rotation (in degrees) if
			applicable.	

:: rounds=N		@Advanced
			Iterate N times. You may want to increase the number
			of default iterations either to recover more extended
			emission (e.g. when 'extended' is set), or to go
			deeper (esp. when the 'faint' or 'deep' options are
			used).
			@See: 'iteration.[?]', 'extended', 'faint', 'deep'

:: rows			@Alias: -> decorrelate.rows
			@Instrument: SHARC-2, P-ArTeMiS
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on detector rows, or set options for it.
			@See: 'decorrelate.<?>'

:: scale=<arg>		Set the calibration scaling of the data. The option
			can take as argument, either:

			    X	    	    An explicit scaling value X, by 
			    		    which the entire scan data is 
					    scaled. E.g.
					    
					      scale=0.92


			    <filename>	    the name of a calibration file, 
			    		    which among other things, contains 
					    the ISO time-stamp and the 
					    corresponding calibration values 
					    for each scan. The filenames follow
					    the usual path conventions of CRUSH
					    and may contain references to 
					    environment variables enclosed in 
					    {} brackets. E.g.:

					      scale={$HOME]}/laboca/scaling.dat

			@See: 'tau', 'gain', 'invert', 'jackknife'


:: scanmaps		@Advanced
			When specified, a map will be written for each scan
			(every time it is solved), under the name 
			'scan-<scannumber>.fits' in the usual output path.
			Best to use as:
			     
			     final:scanmaps
 			
			to avoid the unnecessary writing of scan maps for every
			iteration (unless you really want that to be the case).
			@See: 'final', 'source'

:: scramble		Make a map with inverted scanning offsets. Under the
			typical scanning patterns, this will not produce a
			coherent source. Therefore it is a good method for
			checking on the noise properties of deep maps. The 
			method essentially smears the source flux all over the 
			map. While not as good as 'jackknife' for producing pure
			noise maps, 'jackknife' requires a large number of scans
			for robust results (because of the random inversion),
			whereas 'scramble' can be used also for few, or even 
			single scans to nearly the same effect.
			@See: 'jackknife'
			
:: serial.[...]		@Advanced
			Specify settings to apply when the scan's serial number
			falls within the specified range inside the brackets.
			The range is simply an inclusive range of scan numbers
			separated by colon(s) ':' or hyphen(s) '-'. Wildcards 
			'*' can be used to specify open ranges. E.g.:

			   serial.[*--2593] rotation 15.3

			specifies an instrument rotation of 15.3 degrees up 
			until and including scan 2593.
			@See: 'mjd.[...]', 'date.[...]'

:: signal-response	@Expert
			This is diagnostic option. It affects the console
			output of decorrelation steps. When specified, 
			each decorrelation step will produce a sequence of 
			numbers, corresponding to the normalized covariances of 
			the detector signals in each correlated mode in the
			'modality'. The user may take this number as an 
			indication of the importance of each type of correlated 
			signal, and make decisions based on it, whether a 
			decorrelation step is truly necessary or not. Values
			close to 1.0 indicate signals that are (almost) 
			perfectly correlated, whereas values near zero are 
			indicative of negligible correations.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>', 'division.<?>', 'ordering' 

:: skydip		Reduce skydip data, instead of trying to make an 
			impossibly large map out of it :-). This option is
			equivalent to specifying 'source.type=skydip', which is
			activated conditionally, instead of an alias. The reason
			for not using an alias in this case, is to retain,
			independently, 'skydip' option branches.

:: skydip.fit=<list>	@Expert
			Specify the list of parameters to fit for the skydip 
			model. The standard model is

			  y(EL) = Kelvin * Tsky * (1-exp(-tau/sin(EL))) + offset

		        where:

			   Kelvin	conversion from Kelvin to dataunits.
				   	(see: skydip.Kelvin)

			   Tsky	  	Sky temperature (in Kelvin).
				   	(see: 'skydip.Tsky')

			   tau	 	The in-band zenith opacity
				   	(see: 'skydip.tau')
						 
			   offset	An offset in dataunits 
			   		(see 'skydip.offset')

			The default is to fit Kelvin, tau, and offset, and 
			assume that the sky temperature is close to ambient. 
			(The assumption on the sky temperature is not critical 
			as long as the conversion factor 'Kelvin' is fitted to 
			absorb an overall scaling).
			@See: 'skydip.Kelvin', 'skydip.offset', 'skydip.tau', 
			      'skydip.Tsky', 'dataunit'
					  
:: skydip.Kelvin=X	@Expert
			Specify the (initial) value X to convert from Kelvins 
			to dataunits.
			@See: 'skydip.fit'

:: skydip.offset=X	@Expert
			Specify the (initial) offset value in dataunits
			@See: 'skydip.fit'

:: skydip.tau=X		@Advanced
			Specify the (initial) in-band zenith opacity.
			@See: 'skydip.fit'

:: skydip.Tsky=X	@Advanced
			Specify the (initial) sky temperature in Kelvins.
			By default the ambient temperature (if available) will 
			be used. This option can be use to override with a
			specific value.
			@See: 'skydip.fit'

:: smooth=X		@Advanced
			Smooth the map by X arcsec FWHM beam. Smoothing
			helps improve visual appearance, but is also useful
			during reduction to create more redundancy in the data
			in the intermediate reduction steps. Also, smoothing
			by the beam is optimal for point source extaction from
			deep fields. Therefore, beam smoothing is default in
			with the 'deep' option (see 'deep.cfg').
			Typically you want to use some smoothing during 
			reduction, and you may want to turn it off in the 
			final map. Thus, you may have something like:

			  smooth=9.0			# 9" smoothing at first
			  iteration.[2]smooth=12.0 	# smooth more later
			  iteration.[last]forget=smooth # no smoothing at last

			Other than specifying explicit values, you can use
			the predefined values: 'minimal', 'halfbeam', '2/3beam'
			'beam', or 'optimal'.
			@See: 'smooth.optimal', 'final', 'source.filter', 'grid'
			
:: smooth.external	@Advanced
			Do not actually perform the smoothing set by
			the 'smooth' option. Instead, use the 'smooth'
			value as an assumption in calculating smoothing-related
			corrections. The option is designed for the reduction
			of very large datasets, which have to be 'split' into
			smaller, manageable sized chunks. The unsmoothed outputs
			can be coadded and then smoothed to the desired amount
			before feeding the result back for further rounds of
			reduction via 'source.model'
			@See: 'smooth', 'split', 'source.model'

:: smooth.optimal=X     @Expert
			Define the optimal smoothing for point-source
			extraction if it is different from beam-smoothing.
			For arrays, whose detectors are completely independent,
			beam-smoothing produces the optimal signal-to-noise
			for point sources. However, if the detectors are not
			independent, the optimal smoothing may vary. This is
			expected to be the case for some filled arrays, where
			one expects a certain level of beam-sized photon 
			correlations.
			@See: 'smooth'

:: source		Solve for the source model, or set options for it.

:: source.correct	@Advanced
			Correct peak fluxes for the point source filtering
			effect of the various reduction steps (default). The
			filtering of point sources is carefully calculated
			through the reduction steps, thus with the correction
			scheme, point source fluxes ought to stay constant 
			(within a few percent) independent of the pipeline
			configuration.
			@See: 'faint', 'deep', 'bright', 'ordering', 'whiten'

:: source.coupling	@Advanced
			(Re)calculate point source copling efficiencies
			(i.e., the ratio of point-source and sky-noise
			response) as part of the source modeling step. This is
			only really useful for bright sources.
			@See: 'source.coupling.range'

:: source.coupling.range=min:max	@Expert
					Specify the range of acceptable coupling
					efficiencies relative to the "average"
			of all pixels, when 'source.coupling' is used to 
			calculate these based on bright source responses. Pixels
			with efficiencies outside of the specified range will be
			flagged and ignored from further source modeling steps
			until these flags are cleared again in the reduction.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>.gainrange'

:: source.despike  	@Advanced
			Despike scan maps at. 
			Clearly you want to set X to be higher than the most 
			significant source in your map. Therefore it is only 
			really useful in 'deep' mode, where 5-sigma despiking
			is default (see 'deep.cfg').


:: source.despike.level=X	@Advanced
				Set the source despiking level to an S/N of 
				X. You probably want to set X to be no more 
		    	than about 10 times the most significant source in your
			map. Therefore it is only really useful in 'deep' mode, 
			where a  5-sigma despiking is default (see 'deep.cfg').
			@See: 'despike'	

:: source.filter   	Filter extended structures. By default the filter will
			skip over map pixels that are above the 'blanking' S/N 
			level (>6 by default). Thus any structure above this 
			significance level will remain unfiltered.
			Filtering is useful to get deeper in the map when 
			retaining the very faint extended structures is not 
			an issue. Thus filtering above 5 times the source size
			(see 'sourcesize') is default when the filter is used.
			See the advanced configuration section for further
			details on fine tuning the large-scale structure 
			filter.	

:: source.filter.blank=X	@Expert
				Set the blanking level of the large-scale
				structure (LSS) filter. Any map pixels with an
			S/N above the specified level will be skipped over, 
			and thus remain unaffected, by the filter.
			@See: 'source.filter.fwhm'

:: source.filter.fwhm=X	@Advanced
			Specify the Gaussian FWHM of the large-scale
			structure (LSS) filter. Values greater than
			about 5-times the beam size are recommended in order
			to avoid the unnecessary filtering of compact or point
			sources.
			@See: 'source.filter.blank'

:: source.filter.type=<type>	@Advanced
				Specify the type ('convolution' or 'fft') of 
				the large-scale structure filter. Convolution 
			is more accurate but may be slower than FFT, especially
 			for very large maps.

:: source.fixedgains	@Advanced
			Specifies to use the fixed source gains (e.g. from an 
			RCP file -- see 'rcp' key).
			Normally, crush calculates source gains based on the 
			correlated noise response and the specified point
			source couplings (e.g. as derived from the two gain
			columns of RCP files.). This option can be used to 
			treat the supplied source gains as static (i.e. 
			decoupled from the sky-noise gains).
			@See: 'source.coupling', 'beammap'

:: source.intermediates @Expert
			Write the maps made during the reduction into 
			'intermediate.fits' (inside the crush directory). 
			This option thus allows to keep an eye on 
			the evolution of maps iteration-to-iteration. Each 
			iteration will overwrite this temporary file, and it 
			will be erased at the end of the reduction.

:: source.mem		@Advanced
			Use maximum-entropy method (MEM) correction to the
			source map. The maximum-entropy requirement supresses
			some of the noise on the small spatial scales, and
			pushes solutions closer to the zero level for low S/N
			structures. This increases contrast between significant
			source structures and background. It is similar to the
			MEM used in radio interferometry, although there are
			key differences. (For one, interferometry measures 
			components in the uv-plane, and MEM corrections are
			applied in xy coordinate space. For crush, both the
			solutions and the corrections are applied in the same
			configuration space.)
			@See: 'source.mem.lambda'

:: source.mem.lambda=X	@Advanced
			Specify the desirability of MEM solutions 
			relative to the maximum-likelihood solution.
			Typical values of lambda are in the range 0.1--1, but
			higher or lower values may be set to give extra weight
			towards one type of solution.

:: source.model=<file>  @Advanced
			Specify a in initial source model to use in the
			reduction. This may be useful when reducing 
			large datasets where all data cannot be reduced 
			together. Instead the data can be split in manageable 
			sized chunks, which are reduced separately. The results 
			can be coadded with the 'coadd' utility to create a 
			composite map. This may be further manipulated (e.g. 
			s/n clipping, smoothing, filtering etc.) with 
			'imagetool' before feeding back into another round of 
			reduction. See more in the README on how to deal with
			very large data sets.
			Clipping and blanking settings are usually altered
			(see 'default.cfg') when an a-priori source-model is
			thus defined.
			@WARNING: This feature is not yet thorougly tested.
		 		  Use at you own risk... 
			@See: 'smooth.external', 'clip', 'blank'

:: source.nefd=min:max	@Advanced
			Specify a range of acceptable NEFDs in "Jy sqrt(s)" 
			units. All scans with NEFD outside this range will not 
			contribute to the composite map. If the optional 'min' 
			value is not given, then it is assumed to be 0. ('-' 
			may also be used in place of ':' for separating min and
			max values.) 

:: source.nosync	@Expert
			Do not bother synching the source solution back into the
			raw time-stream. This saves a bit of time in the last
			round of most reductions, when the 'source' is the
			last step in the pipeline, and the residuals are not
			used otherwise, e.g. by 'write.covar', 'write.ascii' or
			'write.spectrum'
			@See: 'write.covar', 'write.ascii', 'write.spectrum'

:: source.polarization  @Instrument: PolKa
			@Advanced
			Specify to yield polarization data (I,Q and U)
			rather than simply producing a total-power image. The
			option obviously only affects instruments that measure
			polarization, anbd will be ignored otherwise.
			@See: 'source.synchronized', 'waveplate.refangle', 
			      'ortho'

:: source.redundancy=N	@Expert
			Specify the minimum redundancy (N samples) that
			each scan-map pixel ought to have in order to be
			considered valid. Pixels with redundancies smaller than
			this critical value will be flagged an not used in
			the composite source mapmaking.

:: source.synchronized 	@Instrument: PolKa
			@Advanced
			CRUSH offers two methods of analyzing 
			polarization data. The default is an inventive method
			that extracts polarization from repeated observations
			over each map pixels, which can be scattered in time. 
			As such, the default method can be used also for fast
			scanning (relative to waveplate rotation). The more
			traditional approach is to scan slowly, and integrate
			an entire waveplate rotation over one map pixel. This
			"synchronized" mode can be selected with this option. It
			is only suitable for reducing data, where telescope
			movement is always less than a map pixel in a quarter
			waveplate cycle.
			@See: 'grid'

:: source.type=<type>	By default, crush will try to make a map from
			the data. However, some istruments may take
			data that is analyzed differently. For example, you 
			may want to use crush to reduce beam maps (to
			determine the positions of your pixels on sky), or
			skydips (to derive appropriate opacities), or do
			point source photometry. Presently, the following
			source types are supported accross the board:
		
			   map 		Make a map of the source (default)

			   skydip	Reduced skydips, and determine 
					opacities by fitting a model to it.

			   beammap	Create individual maps for every
					pixel, and use it to determine their
					location in the field of view.
		
			   null		Do not generate a source model.
					Useful for lab/diagnostic reductions.
	
			Note, that you may also just use 'skydip' and 'beammap'
			shorthands to the same effect. E.g.

			  > crush [...] -skydip [...]

			@See: 'skydip', 'beammap'


:: sources=<filename>	@Advanced
			@Since: 2.02
			Insert test sources into the data, from a catalog 
			specified by <filename>. You can find an example
			catalog in the crush directory, as 'example.mask'.
			The sources are inserted at the beginning of the
			reduction, with the default pixel gains. Since the
			gains are normally adjusted during the reduction the
			recovered source is expected to yield slightly 
			different flux, typically by a few percent. You can
			get a more accurate test calibration by using
			fixed source gains (i.e. decoupling these from the
			sky noise gains) via the 'source.fixedgains' option.
			Thus, the default configuration sets 
			'source.fixedgains' together with the 'sources' option.
			@See: 'source.fixedgains' 

:: sourcesize=X		This option can be used instead of 'extended' in 
			conjunction with 'faint' or 'deep' to specify the 
			typical size of sources (FWHM in arcsec) that are 
			expected. The reduction then allows filtering 
			structures that are much larger than the specified 
			source-size...
			If 'sourcesize' or 'extended' is not specified, then 
			point-like compact sources are assumed.	
			@See: 'faint', 'extended', 'sourcesize'

:: split		A convenience key for adjusting options for very large
			data sets, which have to be split into manageable sized
			chunks in the reduction. See the README for more
			information on the reduction of very large data sets.
			@See: 'smooth.external', 'source.model'

:: squids		@Alias -> correlated.squids
			@Instrument: ASZCA, SABOCA
			@Advanced
			Enable SQUID decorrelation or set options for it.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>'

:: stability=X		@Expert
			Specify the instrument's 1/f stability time scale in 
			seconds. This value is used for optimizing reduction 
			parameters when (e.g. the filtering time scale for the 
			'drifts' option) when these are not explicitly 
			specified.
			@See: 'drifts', 'sourcesize'

:: <subarray>.pixelsize=X,Y	@Expert
				@Instrument: SCUBA-2
				@Since: 2.01-1
			Specify the pixel spacing (in arcseconds) of the 
			<subarray> pixels. Pixels positions are then calculated 
			assuming a rectangular grid with the given spacing.
			E.g.: s8d.pixelsize=6.2,6.1
			@See: '<subarray>.position', '<subarray>.rotation'

:: <subarray>.position=X,Y	@Expert
				@Instrument: SCUBA-2
				@Since: 2.01-1
			Defines the position of the the <subarray> center 
			relative to the pointing center of the instrument as
			comma separated coordinates (in arcseconds) in the
			Nasmyth focal plane.
			E.g.: s4a.position=-12.2,5.3
			@See: '<subarray>.pixelsize', '<subarray>.rotation'

:: <subarray>.rotation=X	@Expert
				@Instrument: SCUBA-2
				@Since: 2.01-1
			Specify the rotation angle (in degrees) of the 
			<subarray>. E.g.: s4a.rotation=45.0 
			@See: '<subarray>.pixelsize', 'subarray.position',
			      'rotation'.

:: subscans.merge	@Expert
			@Instrument: SCUBA-2
			@Since: 2.01-1
			Specifies that the integrations (subscans) in a scans
			should be merged into a single timestream, with
			null frames filling potential gaps at the boundaries
			to ensure proper time-spacing of all data (for time
			window processing or FFT).
			@See: 'subscans.split'

:: subscans.minlength=X	@Expert
			@Instrument: SCUBA-2
			@Since: 2.01-1
			Set the minimum length of inegrations (subscans) to
			X seconds. Integrations (subscans) shorter than the
			specified value will be skipped during the scan
			reading phase.
			Most CRUSH reductions rely on the background variations
			to create signals from which detector gains can be
			estimated with the required accuracy. Very short
			integrations may not have sufficient background signals
			for the robust estimation of gains, and it is thus
			best to simply ignore such data.

:: subscans.split	@Expert
			@Since: 2.01-1
			Instruct CRUSH to split subscans into separate
			scans. This is practical to speed up the reduction
			of single scans with many subscans on machines with
			multi-core CPUs, since CRUSH does not process
			integrations in parallel, but it does parallel process
			scans.
			@See: 'subscans.merge'

:: supergalactic	@Alias -> system=supergalactic
			Make maps in supergalactic coordinates.
			@See: 'system'

:: system=<type>	Select the coordinate system for mapping. The default
			is 'equatorial'. Other possibilities are 'horizontal'
			'ecliptic', 'galactic' or 'supergalactic'. Each of 
			these values is additionally aliased to simple keys. 
			Thus, you may use:
			
			   > crush -galactic [...]
			   
			as a shorthand for '-system=galactic'.
			@See: 'altaz', 'equatorial', 'ecliptic', 'galactic',
			      'supergalactic', 'radec', 'horizontal'	       

:: tau=<arg>		Specify an in-band zenith opacity value to use. E.g.:

			  > crush [...] -tau=0.344 [...]			

			Alternatively, the argument can also specify a 
			file-name with lookup information (usually containing 
			tau values from the radiometer or from the skydips),
			or tau in another band (See 'tau.<?>' option) with an
			approporate scaling relation to in-band values (see
			'tau.<?>.a' and 'tau.<?>.b' options).
			
			When lookup tables are used, the tau values will be 
			interpolated for each scan, as long as the scan falls 
			inside the interpolator's range. Otherwise, tau of 0.0 
			will be used. The filename may contain references to 
			environmnent variables enclosed in {} brackets. E.g.:

			  tau={$HOME}/laboca/tau.dat
			  
			Some instrument (e.g. SHARC-2) may use measurements 
			from a 225GHz radiometer, or some other source, from
			which values can be scaled to in-band. E.g. the 
			combination of options:

			  tau.225GHz=0.033
			  tau=225GHz

			can be used to set tau to it's 225GHz equivalent value.
			(e.g. for SHARC-2).

			SHARC-2 also allows for setting tau to 'direct', for
			a calibrated conversion of bolometer DC levels to
			in-band line-of-sight opacities, when in '350um' mode.
			@see: 'tau.<?>', 'tau.<?>.a', 'tau.<?>.b'


:: tau.<?>=X		@Advanced
			Specify the tau value X for <?>. The <?> can stand for
			any user-specified relation. Some useful conversion
			relations are predefined for certain instruments. E.g.
			some typical values may be one of the following:

			   225GHz	The 225GHz radiometer value.

			   350um	The tau value for the 350um tipper.

			   pwv		millimeters of precipitable water vapor.

			The values will be scaled to in-band zenith opacities 
			using the linear scaling relations defined via the 
			'tau.<?>.a', and 'tau.<?>.b' constants.
			@See: 'tau', 'tau.<?>.a', 'tau.<?>.b'

:: tau.<?>.a=X		@Expert
			Define the scaling term for the opacity measure <?>.
			Zenith opacities are expressed in a linear relationship
			to some user-defined tau parameter t as:

			  tau(<?>) = a*t + b

			This key sets the linear scaling constant 'a' in the
			above equation, while 'tau.<?>.b' specifies the offset
			value. By default the parameter t is set to be the
			225GHz radiometer value (This is achived by setting
			"tau.225GHz.a=1.0" and "tau.225GHz.b=0.0" in 
			"default.cfg").
			@See: 'tau.<?>'

:: tau.<?>.b=X		@Expert
			Set the offset value in a linear tau scaling 
			relationship.
			@See: 'tau.<?>.a' for details.

			@Instrument: LABOCA
			@Expert
			Enable the decorrelation of signals that correspond to
			twisting flexible band cables, or set options for it.

:: uniform		@Expert
			Instruct the use uniform pixel gains initially instead 
			of the values read from the appropriate pixel data file
			@See: 'pixeldata'

:: unit=<name>		Set the output units to <name>. You can use either the
			instrumental units (e.g. 'V/beam' or 'counts/beam') or
			the more typical 'Jy/beam' (default), as well as their
			common multiples (e.g. 'uJy/beam', or 'nV/beam').	
			@See: 'dataunit', 'jansky'

:: vclip=<arg>		@Advanced
			Clip data where the field scan velocity is outside
			the specified range (min:max in arcsec/sec). The 
			successfull disentangling of the source structures from 
			the various noise terms relies on these being separated
			in frequency space. With the typical 1/f type limiting 
			noise, this is harder when the scan speed is low s.t. 
			the source signals occupy the low frequencies. 
			Therefore, requiring a minimum scanning speed is a 
			good idea...
			On the other side, too high scanning speeds will smear
			out sources, if the movement between samples is larger
			than ~1/3 beam.
			The value 'auto' can be specified to set the velocity
			clipping range optimally based on the typical scanning
			speeds.
			@See: 'aclip', 'resolution'

:: wafers		@Alias: -> correlated.wafers
			@Instrument: ASZCA
			@Advanced
			Decorrelate on detector wafers (wedges) or set options
			for it.
			@See: 'correlated.<?>'

:: waveplate.channel=N  @Instrument: PolKa
			@Expert
			Specify the LABOCA channel (counting from 1) that
			carries the waveplate phase information. The waveplate
			phases are critical to recovering the polarization
			information from the data.
			@See: 'waveplate.fchannel', 'waveplate.refangle'
	
:: waveplate.data=<filename>	@Instrument: PolKa
				@Obsolete
				@Expert
			Specify the file containing the waveplate information.
			The data file is a simple sequence of ISO timestamps
			marking the times when the waveplate passes its 
			reference position. By now, the waveplate information
			is merged into the data.
			@See: 'waveplate.channel', 'waveplate.fchannel'


:: waveplate.fchannel=N	@Instrument: PolKa
			@Expert
			The LABOCA channel number (counting from 1),
			which contains the frequency information for the last
			waveplate cycle. This information is not used by crush
			really, but may point the user to where to find this
			information in the raw data, if one wishes to look into
			the details.
			@See: 'waveplate.channel'

:: waveplate.frequency=X	@Instrument: PolKa
				@Obsolete
				@Expert
				Specify the waveplate frequency (in Hz) to 
			assume when detailed waveplate information is not 
			readily available. The waveplate angle of the first
			frame can be set via 'waveplate.refangle'.
			@See: 'waveplate.channel', 'waveplate.refangle'
 
:: waveplate.jitter=X	@Instrument: PolKa
			@Expert
			Specify the typical fractional waveplate jitter.
			This information is used for designing optimal notch
			filters for the total-power mode to reject any waveplate
			modulated residues.
			@See: 'waveplate.channel'

:: waveplate.refangle=X	@Instrument: PolKa
			@Advanced
			Set the waveplate angle at its reference 
			position. The calibration of this position is necessary
			for obtaining meaningful polatization angles. Without
			it only the polarized fluxes, or polarization fractions
			can be measured. The calibration of the reference angle
			requires measurements on sources of known polarization
			(e.g. a wire grid in the pupil)

:: weighting		Derive pixel weights based on the rms of the unmodelled
			timestream signals.

:: weighting.frames	@Advanced
			In addition to pixel weighting, time-weights
			can also be calculated to allow for non-stationary 
			noise. 
			@See: 'weighting.frames.resolution', 'time-weighting'

:: weighting.frames.noiserange=min:max	@Expert
					Set the range of acceptable temporal 
					noise variation.
			Hyphen(s) '-' can also be used instead of colon(s) ':'
			to separate the min and max values. Wildcards can '*'
			indicate open ranges. E.g.
			
			   weighting.frames.noiserange=0.1:*

			@See: 'weighting.noiserange'

:: weighting.frames.resolution=X	@Expert
					By default all exposures are weighted 
					indepently. With this
			option set, weights are derived for blocks of exposures
			spanning X seconds. The value 'auto' can be also used
			to match the time-constant to that of 'drifts'. 
			Time weighting is often desired but can cause 
			instabilities in the reduction, especially if the 
			time-scale is mismatched to the other reduction steps.
			Adjust the timescale only if you really understand what
			you are doing.	
			@See: 'drifts'

:: weighting.method=<name>	@Advanced
				Set the method used for deriving pixel weights 
			from the residuals. The following methods are 
			available:

			   rms	          Standard rms calculation.
			   robust         Use robust estimates for the standard 
			   		  deviation.
			   differential   Estimate noise based on pairs of data
			   		  separated by some interval in time.
					  

:: weighting.noiserange=min:max	@Advanced
				Specify what range of pixel noises are
				admissible, relative to the median pixel
			noise. Pixels that fall outside of the specified range 
			(min and max) will be flagged. Hyphen(s) '-' can also be
			used instead of colons(s) ':' to specify the ranges. 
			Wildcards '*' can specify open ranges. E.g.
			
			   weighting.noiserange=0.3:*

			@See: 'weighting.frames.noiserange'


:: weighting.scans	@Advanced
			If specified, each scan gets an assigned weight
			with which it contributes to the composite map.
			This weight is measured directly from the noise 
			properties of the produced map. 

:: weighting.scans.method=<name>	@Advanced
					'robust' or 'maximum-likelihood'.


:: whitelist=<list>	Remove <option> from the blacklist, allowing
			it to be set again if desired. Whitelisting
			an option will not reinstate it to its prior value. 
			After whitelisting, you must explicitly set it again, 
			or 'recall' or 'replace' it to its prior state.


:: whiten		@Advanced
			Use noise whitening algorithm. White noise assures that
			the noise in the map is independent pixel-to-pixel. 
			Otherwise noise may be correlated on spacific scales.
			Whitening is also useful to get rid of any signals
			(still) unmodelled by the other reduction steps. It
			should always be a last resort only. The modeling of
			signals is generally preferred.

:: whiten.below		@Expert
			@Since 2.00-b2
			By default the whitening filter only supresses
			excessive noise, but will leave those spectral 
			components untouched, where the spectral power is
			deficient. Setting this option allows the boosting of
			such components to the white level, thus achieving
			true noise whitening, which is necessary to obtain maps 
			without instrinsic spacial correlations.
			@See: 'whiten.proberange'


:: whiten.level=X	@Advanced
			Specify the noise whitening level at X times
			the average (median) spectral noise level. 
			Spectral channels that have noise in excess of the
			critical level will be approproately filtered to bring
			them back in line. Values clearly above 1 are 
			recommended. Typically values around 1.5--2.0 are 
			useful without overfiltering.

:: whiten.minchannels=N	@Expert
			@Since: 2.01-1
			Make sure that at least N channels are used for
			estimating the white noise levels, even if the 
			specified probe range is smaller or falls outside of
			the available spectrum. In such cases, CRUSH will
			automatically expand the requested range to include
			at least N spectral channels, or as many as possible
			if the spectral range itself is too small.
			@See: 'whiten.proberange'
	
:: whiten.neighbours	@Expert
			@Since 2.00-b2
			The default whitening method is based on the absolute
			amplitude of spectral components compared to the 
			white noise level. This second method can be activated
			in addition, based on the comparative noise power
			in neighbouring spectral regions (at all resolutions).
			The method is designed to filter to smooth (but
			not necessarily flat) spectral shapes, rejecting
			narrow features effectively, while allowing soft
			rolloffs etc. It may be especially useful when
			'whiten.below' is not enabled, i.e. when spectral
			flatness is not a requirement.

:: whiten.proberange=from:to	@Expert
				@Since 2.00-b2
				Specify the spectral range (in Hz), in
			which to measure the white-noise level before 
			whitening. It is best to use the truly flat part of
			the available spectral range, with no 1/f, resonances
			or lopass roloff are present. Wildcards '*' can be used
			for specifying open ranges.
			@See: 'whiten'
				

:: wiring=<filename>	@Expert
			This option is commonly used to specify a
			file containing the wiring information of
			the detectors, which can be used to establish the
			typical pixel groupings of instruments. There is no
			standard format for the wiring file (it may be
			different for each instrument), and not all instrument
			may use such information.
			@See: 'pixeldata', 'rcp'


:: write.ascii		@Advanced
			Write the residual timestreams into an ASCII table.
			The file will contain as many columns as there are
			pixels in the reduction (see 'noslim'), each 
			corresponding to a pixel time-stream. The first row 
			contains the sampling rate (in Hz). Flagged data is 
			indicated with a NaN character.
			@See: 'noslim', 'write.spectrum'			

:: write.covar[=<list>]	@Expert
			Write covariance data. If no argument is
			specified, CRUSH will write the full 
			pixel-to-pixel covariance data as a FITS image. The 
			optional argument can specify the ordering of the 
			covariance matrix according to pixel divisions. Each
			group in the pixel division will be blocked together
			for easy identifycation of block-diagonal covariance
			structures. Other than the division names, the list
			can contain 'full' and 'reduced' to indicate the full
			covariance matrix if all instrument pixels, or only
			those that were used in the reduction (see 'noslim').
			@See: 'division.<?>', 'noslim'


:: write.pixeldata	@Expert
			Write the pixel data file (gains, weights, 
			flags). The oputput will be 'pixel-<scanno>.dat'.
			You can use these files to update instrumental
			defaults in the instrument subdirectory. E.g., you can 
			overwrite 

				laboca/laboca-pixel.dat

			to change what default pixel settings to use.
			@See: 'rcp', 'wiring'

:: write.signals	@Expert
			Write out all the correlated signals that were
			calculated in the reduction as ASCII timestreams.
			Each signal mode is written in its own file, named
			after the mode's name, and carrying a '.tms' extension.
			The files are simple ASCII timestreams with the 
			sampling frequency appearing in the first row.

:: write.scandata	@Advanced
			Whether or not to add HDUs at the end of the output
			FITS image describing each scan (default). Each scan
			will contribute an extra HDU at the end of the image.
			Disabling this option (e.g. via 'forget') can decrease
			the size of the output images, esp. for large data sets
			containing many scans.

:: write.scandata.details	@Advanced
				@Since 2.00-b2
				When the option is enabled, 'write.scandata'
			will add extra detail into the FITS outputs, such as
			channel gains, weights and flags, spectral filtering
			profiles and residual noise power spectra.
			@See: 'write.scandata'

:: write.spectrum[=window] 	@Expert
				Writes channel spectra (of residuals) into an 
			ASCII table. The optional argument can specify a window
			function to use. The available window functions are:
			'Rectangular', 'Hamming', 'Hann', 'Nutall', 'Blackman'
			'Blackman-Harris', 'Blackman-Nutall', and 'Flat top'.
			The default is 'Hamming'.
			The first column indicates the frequency, after which
			come the power-spectral-densities (PSD) of each channel
			used in the reduction (see 'noslim').
			@See: 'write.ascii', 'noslim'

:: write.spectrum.size=N	@Expert
				Specify the windowsize (in powers of 2) to use
			for measuring spectra. By default, the spectral range
			is set by the 1/f filtering timescale.
			@See: 'drifts'
