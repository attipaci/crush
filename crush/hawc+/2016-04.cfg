# CRUSH April/May 2016 configuration overriders for SOFIA/HAWC+
#
# Author: Attila Kovacs <attila@submm.caltech.edu>
# Description:
#       This configuration file is auto loaded for HAWC+ scans 
#       taken during the commissioning run in April/May 2016.
#       Users may define their own startup configuration in 
#       ~/.crush2/hawc+/default.cfg which will be parsed
#    	immediately after the global defaults contained here.
# See: crush/README, crush/hawc+/README
