# Description:
#       This configuration file is automatically loaded when Band D (155um)
#       HAWC+ data is reduced with CRUSH. Users may define their own amended
#       configurations in ~/.crush2/hawc+/band-D.cfg which will be parsed
#       immediately after the global defaults contained here.
