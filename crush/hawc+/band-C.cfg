# Author: Attila Kovacs <attila@submm.caltech.edu>
# Description:
#       This configuration file is automatically loaded when Band C (89um)
#       HAWC+ data is reduced with CRUSH. Users may define their own amended
#       configurations in ~/.crush2/hawc+/band-C.cfg which will be parsed
#       immediately after the global defaults contained here.
# See: crush/README, crush/hawc+/README

# The conversion factor (counts/Jy).
# Based on Uranus 354.2 and Bendo et al. model.
# Effective value at 'typical' opacities
#jansky 7.10

# Based on Uranus and Neptune at different elevations and PWV:
jansky 8.33

# Zenith tau scaling relation to PWV...
tau.hawc_plus.a 0.0049
tau.hawc_plus.b 0.079

# Calibration for skydip fitting...

# Produce Level 3 if 'calibrated', else Level 2, products...
