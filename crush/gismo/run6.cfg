# The conversion factor (counts/Jy).
# Based on Neptune scans 30-40 on 2012-04-11
# The value should be good to a <~2% rms
# This calibration is for integrated flux in apertures at least a few times
# larger than the beam.

# Recalibrated based on Uranus 2013-11-03, based on Bendo et al. 2013 model
# This calibration is suspect, as it is about 10-15% different from previous
# days. Perhaps the tau was not representative at this time...

# This calibration is based on 0221+067, observed on 2012-11-01 and 02, 
# both with a bias of 12K and 16K. Even though this calibration was obtained
# in Run 7, the setting has been retroactively applied to Run 6, since it
# is ultimately based on the Run 6 calibration.
