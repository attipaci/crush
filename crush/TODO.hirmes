> Spectral mapping convention (mm x,y on focal plane with appropriate coordinate system --> frequency). Discuss with Rick and agree on convention.

> SofiaSpectroscopyData (heterodyne keywords?)

> Observer velocity / source radia velocity (probably in spectroscopy)

> Rest frame default (observing frame optional)

> Hi-res spectroscopy:
	- FITS key to identify array used.
	- spatial/frequency mapping recipe
